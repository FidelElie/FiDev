This was another artist that I found myself listening to from the
[Color's Show YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@COLORSxSTUDIOS) and after getting
past the crazy make up, this girl knows how to spit. I have to agree with Carlos and say
she may not be everyone's cup of tea, but damn this song's beat, her delivery and the bars
to an extent really make the song for me. The song is one huge pop off by her, telling
everyone why she is the shit and no one can compare. And this may not be true in the grand
scheme of things, but she sure does believe it. I guess that is what I like about the
song sometimes you just need to pop off and make sure people know you're the shit. Rico
does that pretty well.
