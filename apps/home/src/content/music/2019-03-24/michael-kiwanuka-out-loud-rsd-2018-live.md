I first heard Michael Kiwanuka's songs on the radio and subsequently gave his album
:album[0qxsfpy2VU0i4eDR9RTaAU][Love & Hate] a listen. It was almost a life changing experience
to hear this man's style in his songs. The album tells a story that I just love to hear again
and again. So, when I heard him on Little Simz's album :album[3Z8Df4ghTJ7afEWkurB2I1][Grey Area]
and found myself on his Spotify page with something 'new' to listen to, I was excited to say
the least. I say 'new' because this album is a live  performance of songs I had heard before
in Love and Hate. In addition, to the performance unlike PJ Morton's live rendition of
:album[7wAWsia8smE3scMtlO0nOx][Gumbo] which
deviates quite a lot from the Studio offering, this is a very similar experience, just a live
enhancement.

This just reminds me of what I love about the guy, it sounds very similar to the album - his
vocals are great I must say. With some of the flavour and atmosphere that comes with a live
performance. What is there not to like about it. It was just a reminder of the album that
gave me a lot of happiness and this is your opportunity to listen to it to, whether it live
or otherwise go and listen to Michael Kiwanuka.

:future-comment[
  If you're going to listen to any songs on this, listen to Father's Child. It is definitely
  my favourite on both versions of the album.
