I don’t see it what it is with me when it comes to Logic these days. But it just seems like
I am in another world compared to his fans, which I considered myself to be a part of until
Everybody’s release last year. Now it seems everything that they lose their minds over, I am
just like “It is alright definitely an improvement over his last album’s stuff”. But for me
the is single is just tolerable. I won’t even keep it on my playlists for a while after finishing
this post. I didn’t really appreciate his singing in this, it just didn’t sit right with me
for the song. I’m sorry to say it is not an improvement of the last single Logic released
44 More and I hope that if he releases a project along the lines of Bobby Tarantino it comes
correct. Or Logic’s last album will be something I will be dreading until it’s release.
