Okay let me start this off by saying that I generally dislike spoken word to music. So, when
I hear a guy called George the poet on Spotify - I am reluctant to say the least - but I gave
this song a listen because of my man Maverick and Jorja and I was happy with it. It doesn’t
do anything ground breaking, but I do like the chorus as the Jorja and Maverick’s voice mesh
really well. And George didn’t commit any spoken word sins in my mind so overall it was a
good listen.
