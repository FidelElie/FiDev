My girlfriend asked me if I had heard the SiR song Jay Z and this is the conversation that followed:

:lyrics[
  Me: “It doesn’t ring any bells” 
  Young Spinach: “I thought you said you listened to this guy? I listened to him because of you!” 
  Me: “Word I’ll give this album a listen soon” 
][
  My Life
] 

I’m paraphrasing of course but I thought I would write some bars. I remember I hadn’t really
sat down and listened to his past project Seven Sundays so I decided to go back and do just that.
And it is good, there are some songs that I really like on it and some songs that I find a
bit more forgettable. I still prefer :album[5zdFKRmlSDwAMZ5NFVGbx9][Summer in November]
but this project has songs that deserve a place on my playlist just listen to Jay Z and
you’ll see why. SiR thank you for giving me my R&B fix.
