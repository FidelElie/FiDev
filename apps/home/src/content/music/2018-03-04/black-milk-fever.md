Black Milk’s Sunday’s Best and Monday Worst are two amazing tracks that continue from each
other (shoutouts to Cheese for putting me onto it) and that is what led my discovery of
this serious rapper. So when I saw his latest album Fever I thought I would give it a
listen and after a few listen I really like it. The production on the project seems to have
a lot of influences from funk, with punchy baselines and riffs and Milk shows why I think he
is mean with his raps:

:lyrics[
  4 in the AM
  Trying to paint a profound picture
  Holding the brush, won’t put it down
  Till I put the right colors inside your sound system
][But Can It Be#4KdT67SkWs1sWUHDyAUsra]

The flow he brings to these bars alone is mad. The project is a great listen and I am
solidified as a Black Milk fan, give his newest project a listen.

:lyrics[
  Its like officer, officer
  What have you done
  How many apples can spoil a bunch
  You just need one
  So if you can't stand up
  When fellow officers shoot a kid with they hands up
  I don't know who we can trust
][Drown#6H7wzIGOjI8pAkUMVCEEKf]
