<q>It’s Santan<q>. It definitely is. I really like Dave’s vibes in his raps, the piano that is
the centre piece to this song’s beat just fits so well with his bars.

:lyrics[
  When we were young, we had dreams of being bosses
  Ballers, doctors, lawyers in an office
  So how did that turn into dropping out of college
  Snaps in a prison cell, bodies in a coffin
][Hangman]

The song is a biography of his experiences and the lessons he has learned. These are themes
that are familiar when I think of Dave but he does it so well that it just makes me want to
hear more. I need to go and listen to his project :album[5QsGJ1tErNh5aWxowJojom][Game Over]
of which I didn’t get the chance to and hopefully Dave is cooking on some more, I’m eagerly
waiting.
