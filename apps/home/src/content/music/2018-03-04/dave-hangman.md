"It’s Santan". It definitely is. I really like Dave’s vibes in his raps, the piano that is
the centre piece to this song’s beat just fits so well with his bars.

The song is a biography of his experiences and the lessons he has learned. These are themes
that are familiar when I think of Dave but he does it so well that it just makes me want to
hear more. I need to go and listen to his project Game Over of which I didn’t get the chance
to and hopefully Dave is cooking on some more, I’m eagerly waiting.
