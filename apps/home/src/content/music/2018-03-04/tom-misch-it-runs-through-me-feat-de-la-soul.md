Tom, Tom, Tom... Tom. Can you just release the album already? This song bangs. The riff is
just too infectious, makes me have to move something. Just a great feel good sound.

> Where I'll go, cant explain I'll never know, but it's beautiful.
-from It Runs Through Me

Him talking about the sound he makes just sounds awesome. And with each element popping in
as he sings about it, is just a great touch. De la Soul’s feature bumps too the flow fits
the song super well, really smooth and the bars follow the same formula:

> The bounce in my bones, the jazz in my spine,
> The hop is my home, rap is my grind
-from It Runs Through Me

I’m just wondering what Misch is waiting for just release the album already.
