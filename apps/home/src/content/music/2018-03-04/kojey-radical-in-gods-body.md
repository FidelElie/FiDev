Featured on last week’s songs of note (check it out here), I decided to listen to Kojey’s
most recent project and wasn’t particularly blown away by it. It take a departure from the
style that he showed in his mad about bars Spotify special. A style which fits his bars and
flow (which I have heard frequently being compared to Kendrick’s) very well might I add.
Didn’t always sit well with me in this project. There are some exceptions though where
production comes into play and Kojey stretches his legs (or chords). I want to give it
some more listens just to solidify my opinion but give it a listen anyway it in’t bad by
any means, it’s just not amazing to me at the moment.
