This is the first part in Rejjie Snow's redemption for me. If you haven't checked out the
last podcast episode entitled "The Grammy's Featuring Raw Sauce" check it out her, me and
Dre's agreed that Rejjie's last album was one of the most disappointing projects of the
year. As a result, I came in to these two outings with low expectations, but I was happy
with it. Don't get me wrong it does not give me the same feeling as his previous singles
D.R.U.G.S and Blckst Skn but it was nice. Dear Annie part 1 is more of the chill section
to the two part series, with very mellow beats and Snow's signature tonality is the right
balance. Where I think in his previous album "The Moon & You" the balance was just not
there and it led to the vast majority of the songs being completely forgettable.

This is the much more upbeat part of the series and my personal favorite. This preference
is not necessarily due to the tone of the project but more how it is executed. The song
Annie is greatly bolstered by the always amazing vocals of Jesse Boykins and Room 27
with Dana Williams adding alot to this song. I liked it and I know I mentioned the
features more then Rejjie himself in this one. But that is not necessarily a bad thing.
These two parts of the album overall showed me that he can still make music I like, to me at the
end of the day I'm looking at the whole package and if it works, why try and argue?
