I was dancing all the way through this one, it was recommended by a friend and it definitely
went under the radar for me before this. I'm glad though, what she brings to the new R&B
era is welcome and unique. I don't think she shows anything ground breaking in her voice
throughout the project. But for me it is the full package of each song that makes it so
great. For example in the song Sticky the best bit is:

> Wooo ooh ooh ooh
-taken from Sticky - Crush EP

How she delivers this line just send chills down my spine (that was unintentional) and
this continues throughout. Shoutouts to Manny I definitely urge you to give it a listen,
you won't be disappointed.
