I didn't even know SiR was the newest member of TDE (Top Dawg Entertainment) and his debut
project with the label didn't disappoint. I really love space so the concept of the album
was already a step in the right direction for me. SiR's chill vocals just complement the
production so well, And the features most notably from Schoolboy Q and Etta Bond make the
first half of the album that much better. The second half did not speak to me as much as
the first, but that might change after a few more listens. And overall I still think it is
the solid album that you should give a listen to if your in the mood for some new R&B.

In the case of the last song - Summer in November - some forces just cannot be explained
but after listening to this song it is just a masterpiece to me. The vocals, the
instrumental, it is the perfect length where I want to listen to it again but I don't feel
cheated with it being short.... I am going to stop, just listen to it yourself see what you
think.
