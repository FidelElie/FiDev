I really like the folk that Jordan brings to the table. He has a very good discography so
far with his :album[0bXMgEiBAo5mWBHfPYFisL][Physics EP] and Tales From The Broken. So usually
when I see he has released a new single I usually save as I there is a high chance, that I will
like it so I might as well put it in its home new beforehand. With his latest outing however,
I'm not sure if it will remain. It is not a bad track by any means, it just didn't give me
the same feelings that some of his other tracks have in the past. For example, his song
:track[3QxbFta0WRzKJ7aUVUh9Iz][Battlecry] is what I would say is a masterpiece of composition.
The lyrics being a chant:

:lyrics[
  I won't stay silent
  Even without air in my lungs

  Battlecry - Tales from the Broken:2bSpTqSadpN6L96ASiURUb
]

Said by only him initially but as the crowd starts to form and move to their destination,
the tempo of the song increases, the volume follows suit and the people join in, to the
point where you feel part of a revolution. It is this reason why I'm not sure if this song
will stay in my playlist. The vocals are nice from Jordan and the woman but that is what
is of note. It is a cover as I first suspected but doesn't bring anything that stands out
to me. I'm going to stick with the rest of his amazing library and I'm waiting to see an
album from him.

  Can you hear the people marching louder than the drums?
