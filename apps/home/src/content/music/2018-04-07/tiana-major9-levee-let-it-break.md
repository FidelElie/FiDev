The latest discovery from [Colours Show](https://www.youtube.com/@COLORSxSTUDIOS) I love the
old school vibes to this song, the instrumental is cold, and her vocals are something to
experience. Even when she raps half way through the song, I've got to say she's probably
better than a lot of the rappers these days (maybe even someone who is mentioned later on in
this post, well she is easily better than him but still need to keep the suspense). I like
what I have heard now I'm just waiting for some new stuff to grace her Spotify profile, and
EP perhaps? And on a side note her colors performance of this song is great with a nice
outfit change in the middle of it and she shows how good she is at singing.
