I'm going to start this off by saying that Oddisee has been one my favorite rappers for years
now. His lyrics are amazing and I like how his beats are simple but still do so much for the
song. Which is a far cry from all the super layered stuff that you hear today, that sometimes
seems like a waste of time. These beats also allow his music to translate very well to live
performances with real instruments and not just playing it off a laptop at the gig. And with his band
he proves this every time he goes on tour and this album is something great. It reaffirmed
some old loves like :track[4vrT1syG3K1XNBiDJaxEUN][You Know Who You Are] and made me realise there
was songs I forgot about from his newest album like :track[61si8kfjCZJR8oaBWSq73W][Built By Pictures].
This is an amazing live performance from an amazing artist and band. If you haven't heard
of him before, you have now so give him a listen, I love him and I hope you will too.
