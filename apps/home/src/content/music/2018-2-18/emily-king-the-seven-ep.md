This is just a great project, the instrumentation is so clean and I love Emily King's voice.
It's pretty simple with this one to be honest, if your going to listen to any song on the
project I would say listen to Radio. The drop in this song alone could propel the project
alone and these themes go throughout all the songs with the production really carrying you
through. Listen to this, listen to her album the switch, I am a big fan of her soul
influence, so see what you think.
