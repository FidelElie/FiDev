I bought his entire discography to use on the YouTube channel ( if you haven’t checked it
out I’ve got a few videos on it here) and decided to start from the top when listening to
his stuff. Beets 4 is great, I really like Birocratics sound, where it just transports me
back to San Fran or if I was just riding in an open-top car in Cali the vibes are there
and I suggest you join me on the ride. I wasn’t feeling everyone of his creations as much
as some others but god do some of them hit. He’s a sick beat maker and I’m looking forward
to hearing what else he has on offer.
