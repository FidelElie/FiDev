I didn't know that Saba was releasing something new until a few friends told me over
the week that is was a must listen, I've got to say this album is easily on par with
:album[7wsj4nv8jBENZT3IfcfnWA][Bucket List Project]. It is a very somber album with its
sad themes and dark beats and melodies. But it has made me happy every time I listen to it
as the production is great throughout the project. It has a lot of dark undertones still
with the drill influences that I associated with Saba's overall style. The story-telling
is also top notch on this album, just listen to the song :track[3mTBcwM1BTiF6HR7D0SIcH][PROM/ KING]
and :track[0qJw8E4X3QGCRoSZ7WBRT5][FIGHTER] and you'll see what I am talking about. Development
is shown from Bucket List Project that is greatly appreciated. So far one this is one of
this year's best, Saba killed it.

:future-comment[
  This is still a great album with a lot to love on it, I am surprised I didn't even mention
  songs like CALLIGRAPHY or GREY previously - but those are still my favourites. It also
  goes without saying that BUSY/SIRENS is a masterpiece - perfectly put together. Recently
  I even went back watched the music video for SIRENS and that is an experience it itself.
  I linked it below for you viewing pleasure, I
