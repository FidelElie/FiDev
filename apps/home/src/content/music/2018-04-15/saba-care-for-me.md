I didn't know that Saba was releasing something new until a few friends told me and I over
the week I've had to listen to it, I've got to say this album is easily on par with Bucket
List Project. It is a very somber album with its sad themes and dark beats and melodies.
But it has made me happy every time I listen to it as the production is great throughout
the project. It has a lot of dark undertones still with the drill influences that I
associated with Saba's overall style. The story-telling is also top notch in this album,
just listen to the song PROM/ KING and FIGHTER and you'll see what I am talking about.
Development is shown from Bucket List Project that is greatly appreciated. So far one of
this year's best, Saba killed it.
