This song has been making waves lately with everyone I have seen on social media or spoken
to in person. And I can see why, it is probably the best Drake song I have heard in a long
time. The beat is out of his world with the Lauryn Hill sample and a sound that reminds me
of the days of songs like :track[3QLjDkgLh9AOEHlhQtDuhs][Best I Ever Had] and even
:track[238Sekyg7DyN2XDm0z4oWY][Fancy]. The hard as nails kick, the quick snares is just the
vibe that I have been looking for from Drake for a while now. The lyrics even have a positivity
that I heard all those years ago in Drake previous songs. And the video for it brings this
home even more, great vocals, amazing video, this song was for the culture.

Well done Drake keep it up.
