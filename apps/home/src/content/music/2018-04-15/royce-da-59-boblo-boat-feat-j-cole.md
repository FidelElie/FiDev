When I saw that the Black Hokage was listening to this song (Check out his channel here,
love his stuff) with Royce and J, I had to listen to it. I love these smooth beats with
vocals that are not at the forefront of the song but add a lot to the overall experience.
I also really like when J sings, I'm not sure if this is the unpopular opinion but he can
hold a note - he may say different on the song Beautiful Bliss - but he knows how to make
it work. Keeping to what your capable of can still result in something great, rather than
trying to fit notes that you know won't happen and it results in a crackly mess. Cole has
does this for ages now and I want to give him the credit he deserves for it The bars are
also top notch in this:

> This was my main concern back when concerns were lesser
> Nowadays, I often yearn to press the
> Backspace button or hit return but life is not no word processor
> - taken from Boblo Boat - said by J. Cole

And Royce talking about his family:

> Nothing compared to our family trips
> My uncle shook hands with a manly grip
> All this hand-me-down-shit, I had had an uncanny fit

The bars about a boat ride are great in this song and with Royce's album coming soon, this
song has got me really excited, give this hip hop a listen it is some great stuff.
