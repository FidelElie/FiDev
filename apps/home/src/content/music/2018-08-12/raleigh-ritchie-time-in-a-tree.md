It's like me and Mr Ritchie are on the same wavelength, as I was getting a hankering for some
new stuff. So much so that I had some content planned for him on the site. He decides to
release something new and it is a solid song. Very solid in fact. It has all the trademark
signs of a Raleigh Ritchie song for me. Genre bending check, some great vocals from the man
himself. I'm just a massive fan of his work.

Him (Greyworm in Game of Thrones) and Childish Gambino. (Troy in Community, because yeah
I've been listening to him for ages, way before Because the Internet came out. Sorry had
to be one of those fans for a moment). To me, they are the perfect examples that good can
come out of watching a TV show other than laughs, drama or suspense. I found an artist
who hasn't done any wrong in my eyes when it comes Raleigh, he makes the music he feels
like making and it shows. How can I be against that? Now I'm just waiting for the next
album to drop....
