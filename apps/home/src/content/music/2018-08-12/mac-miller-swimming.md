First off what does this album fall under? Hip Hop, funk, a bit of soul? I don't really know.
But that is probably why I love it so much. I think this album is the love child of his
previous albums of :album[2Tyx5dLhHYkx6zeAdVaTzN][GO:OD:AM] which accounts for the rapping.
And The :album[6f6tko6NWoH00cyFOl4VYQ][Divine Feminine] which was predominantly smooth R'n'B
and some funk in places. It results in his best album yet in my humble opinion. Mac has his
own style and he sticks to it, he is not the best rapper no but he does come up with some good stuff like:

:lyrics[
  And the stroke is just so PGA

  Small Worlds:4gT3mNJA8lnlkYFqGZ8IA2

  Just a pretty smart line for what he is talking about
]

He's not the best vocalist, but he can hold a note, so when he sings it's nothing but flames.
With no faux pas when it comes to autotune. The production is great throughout the album
with only one song I can say that I wasn't really feeling. The rest, was awesome. He makes
some great music, I hope he keeps it up with the next one. For now though I'm going to
have this on repeat.
