Story time incoming, so I was watching a YouTube video on the game Rainbow Six Siege.
I say watching it, I had it in the background while I was doing other things. And for those
who have never watched a video related to this game. If you are not watching the professionals
compete on the official [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWKHac5bjhsUtSnMDFCT-7A)
channel. The other content creators are consumed by memes. Which I do find quite entertaining at times,
but I've got to say the music they use in a lot of their videos. And this is not centered around
one specific creator a lot of them do this. Sucks as they use super loud dub step tracks,
so as a result I usually can't get into that aspect of the video.

But at ending of one of the videos, I heard a remix of this song and for some reason I was
really drawn to it. I have tried to pinpoint why, and the best I can come up with was the
sample used. It is a song that I really like but have forgotten the name to; and I think
how the artist used it doesn't take away from this centerpiece. It is electronic yes, but
I have no problem with that as long as it brings more to the table than, over produced synths
and crazy amounts of sub bass. So what else can I say? I like the song, if someone can let me
know where the sample comes from it would be much appreciated.
