I've heard of jungle in passing and I decided in a late night bout of curiosity to go and
listen to their album. From what I'd heard of them thus far, they were very upbeat so
this would fuel the writing of my coding projects I've been doing lately.
And after listening through, the style that is used by Jungle is solid. So solid in fact
that it doesn't deviate from the heavy electronic interest and accompanying vocals throughout
the project. Making some of the songs feel more like throwaways then anything. The songs
I really liked Julia and Busy earning, the latter of which I have heard before. I think
deviate from this fact the most, leading to them being stand out of course. It is not a
bad album by any means, I just expected a bit more from this then was provided.
