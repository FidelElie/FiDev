This has been a great year for R'n'B and all its subsidiaries. And after Carlos has been
pestering me to listen to this project. With it being some of the best things hes listened
to in a while. And after listening to it he was right, this three song EP is up there with
some of the other great EP. It gives the likes of some of my favorites so far like :post[music/2018-02-08/sir-november:Sir - November]
a run for its money, in pure quality terms. Each of the songs on it have a very
distinct feel to them. With the influences changing as you go through it. From a more
focused R'n'B song in Tried Up to a very jazz influenced song in Wire (my favorite song
by miles, I'm a sucker for horns).

Even Wrong Lesson, which initially I wasn't feeling as much as the other songs. Takes it
back in terms of its R'n'B influences and sounds more like something from the nineties.
With the super punchy baseline, the hard kick and synth. To me it seems like this was intentional,
it's like going back in time to the roots almost. Which is bought home by the last song,
god I love horns ( I know I've said that already, but still). It almost tells a story when
you listen to it, where she was going with this project. The 10 minute video that I need to
get round to listening to, absolutely makes sense to me when listening to the songs without it.
She made some great songs and I'm looking forward to seeing what she makes next and I will
watch the video.... Eventually. Check it out for yourself below.
