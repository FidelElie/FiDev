For the feel good of the week, Towkio brought the heat. I discovered him through my man
Chance the rapper as they both are part of the same collective and they have always made
hits for me. So when I saw Towkio chilling in his space suit on the album cover, me being
excited was definitely an understatement. What I like about him is that I think his use of
auto tune or voice modulation (in most instances) doesn't actually do anything to hamper
the overall song and instead bolsters it. Whereas in some instances unless your T-pain
I find there is a very high chance that i will end up cringing over it. Its different party
music if I was to describe it in a couple of words and I like it. Not much more to say about
it, give it a listen, especially if you feel like dancing.
