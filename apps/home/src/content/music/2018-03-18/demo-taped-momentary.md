This project was a bit of a unintentional listen, but a welcome one this week. I got round to
listening to this relatively new release and was left feeling a bit torn. I like the synths
but I didn't really get that much from any of the songs other than :track[16Hc163Y0iTlNuh7hqEwRU][Insecure].
The production is good on it and I will look out for more from this artist. He at least caught
my attention, so I will be looking to see what he does next while listening to Insecure
(Was really feeling that song).
