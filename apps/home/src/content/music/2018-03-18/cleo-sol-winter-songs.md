My latest Colour's show discovery made me instantly save her project to listen to later.
And I loved it, her sound is very chilled and more airy but mostly I love the instrumentation.
Where do I start? The horns, the strings, the airy vocals, the backing it all sounds amazing
and just all comes together to make some great songs. The song Still Cold alone, makes the
project for me. Let me keep going the use of flutes, the vibe, the smooth and thoughtful lyrics.
Miss Soul made a great project and I'm going to happily keep this in rotation for weeks to
come. Bring on some more I'm looking forward to it.
