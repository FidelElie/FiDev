To start, this is a special project as it is marks my return to actually writing my thoughts
about anything on the world wide web for the last half decade - it's good to be back and to
anyone who reads this thank you. I hope the music and posts - old and new - can fill you with
the joy I felt resurrecting this old project of mine. Now lets get some songs on your playlists.

I have never been a fan of reggaeton - the genre has always fallen into the repetitive
for me but thanks to a friend of mine (shout outs to the princess herself) she did put me on
to a winner with this one. This is not only one of the best beats I have heard all year in 2024
(the start of the song gives me chills - what a great sample) but Bad Bunny is a force to
be reckoned with even if his name is kinda cute.

He brings the heat throughout the song, not that I can understand much of what he says but
it is the perfect cadence and energy to get me gassed. So much so that this was on repeat
while I did the final touches for the first release of this new website that you are reading
this on. Maybe there is some merit to this reggaeton thing or maybe this song has less of
the normal influences that I am use to heading with this genre and that is why i like this song so
much. Either way, thank to this song: I think I am open to exploring and its not like I'm not going to get these
songs thrown at me these days anyway (she is on a crusade for me to like it). But, if they are
anything like this one keep them coming - do not skip this one and give the video a watch as well - a true vibe.
