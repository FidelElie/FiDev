Earlier this week when I was at uni I had the chance to talk about music with a cool guy.
He recommended I listen to this song from Kodak and it turns out I agree with everything he
mentioned when describing it to me. The beat is awesome, it has a really nice funky tone to
it that I like and would love to know who produced it. And there is Kodak's contribution to
song - while still in prison might I add. It sounds like it was recorded through a shoe,
both of us was definitely joking about him speaking in to a Nokia brick and someone recording
it on the other end. it sounds like it, but  I find it comical more than anything. I knew
this song was not going to make me a Kodak black fan but It was a nice listen by how good
the beat was. So shoutouts to Dennis, keep the recommendations coming I'm all ears.
