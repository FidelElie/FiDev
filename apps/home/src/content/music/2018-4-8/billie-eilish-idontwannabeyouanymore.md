Another Colors show discovery, I was hesitant to click the link when I saw the thumbnail
but I'm glad I did. This is some pop that I can get into, her voice is really good and the
harmonies in the chorus really make the song for me. I don't have that much to say about it
other then don't judge a book by its cover. Always keep an open mind, I try to as much as
I can and it payed off this time. Good song and good performance, listen, watch and enjoy.
