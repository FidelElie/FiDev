A late discovery that was released last year, Mr Jukes brings that good jazz influence to
his songs. There is a good few songs that Iv'e had in rotation this week with
:track[0uLijBRekQsSPwHs1LIEXz][Grant Green] being the standout. But some of them  I did
think was a miss. The album did not hit the bulls-eye but was still somewhere on the target.
There is still a lot to like about this album and the songs that hit for me, really hit and
I have had them on repeat for a while now. So give it a listen I am sure you will find something.
