First off dave east is always nice with the raps and when paired with Ferg doing what I
think he does best, It leads to a great song, that has had a place on my gassed playlist
(check it out here). I really like the bars in the hook:

> Ey I'm like a bad doctor, I ain't got no patience
-taken from Paper Chasin

Love the play on words and love the song, give it a listen if your in the mood to get gassed.
