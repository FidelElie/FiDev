I decided on one of my most stressful days this week to make this the soundtrack to my run.
And I forgot how much I loved this album and I think it doesn't get the shine it deserves.
Before the pure consciousness of the later projects, j did both. Flexed a bit on some songs
and spoke some real shit on others. The production wasn't a sore point of this album either,
the beats hit hard and I to me they still had that flavor that you could be like "Yeah this
has J. Cole written all over it". He hadn't carved out his niche fully yet, but I don't think
Born sinner was the beginning either, this was. This is definitely one of the greats but I
will have a lot more to say about this later.

:lyrics[
  Up in first class, laugh even though it's not funny
  See a white man wonder how the fuck I got money
  While he sit at coach, hate to see me walk past
  Young black pants sag, headphones blastin'
  Know what he askin', "How did he manage?"
  "With all the cards against him, he used them to his advantage!"

  Turns out I don't have much more to say about this, I love this album it's not his best
  but one of my favourites - leave it alone Dre. I still go back and watch the extended
  video of sideline story on Youtube (put it below for your enjoyment)
