I was hopeful when Carlos said to me the Col3trane's newest EP was fire. My liking his music
had stopped since hearing the song Penelope on colours. Unfortunately, this hasn't really
changed for me after listening to this. I honestly find it jarring to listen to, the entire
project reminds me of the switch up towards the end of Penelope that I personally think took
away from the song. I don't like him, singing over this type of beat and from what I've
heard the newest one follows this as well, with more occurrences.

Credit where credit is due the EP overall does sound a lot more varied than his last album.
The features are pretty strong on this project too. But this doesn't take away from the
overlying sound that I think has plagued him since my first listening. If I was trying
to be fair, I would say that maybe I have just been spoilt lately. I have listened to a
lot of great R&B these past couple weeks, with jazz influences, old and new alike. And I
could say I was just looking for something different because of this when listening to
Col3trane. The only problem is after listening to this, I'm not sure if I would ever be
looking for this... Pretty disappointing if you ask me.
