An oldie but a goodie I thought I would talk about one of my favorite Stevie Wonder songs.
I found myself going through my old playlist. This was the old starred playlist that Spotify
changed ages ago and it definitely has some old gems on it (Check it out here if you are
interested). I stumbled across this song again and I was instantly reminded why I love it
again. The instrumentation, the chorus, the versus, the backing, should I go on? It an
amazingly well put together songs. But when does Stevie do anything different? One of my
absolute favorites and it might be yours too, give this song a listen.
