I really enjoyed listening to Skepta's newest album. Carlos mentioned it was solid and when
I watched Skepta's performance of No Sleep on Colors Show. I was definitely interested in
listening to this and my interest wasn't miss placed. It has all the flexing that I expect
from a Skepta album:

:lyrics[
  The way I stepped in there with the SK Air, fam' serious tekkers
  Brand new vest, same old leathers
  She know we are the real Goodfellas
][
  Pure Water:27H75QUZMb6C0vNfN3T370
]

But what is really welcome for me with this outing is the songs that have a lot more than
flexing to say.

:lyrics[
  You'll see, a wise man once told me
  You gotta live within your means
  You got a pocket full of cash
  But yo ugotta have a lot more than what's in your jeans
][

There's a lot of bars to quote from this album. The production is also good too, I didn't
listen to his last album :album[6s4vWWWxNrGcKhrOFYRZzk][Konnichiwa] but this does make me
interested in going back. Definitely one of the most solid albums of the year.

:lyrics[
  Row Row row you boat gently down the stream
  Niggas sleeping on me must be Sippin' on the lean
