British Trap... Admittedly, I haven't listened to that much of it. But after listening to k2
I think that will have to change. From hearing the producers tag line Killer Krash with the
gas throughout the songs, you know what you are in for with the entire EP. Kasien brings
some serious energy to the raps, his flow is on point the production is ridiculous in this
project. Kelvin Krash knows how to make some serious trap beats. There is nothing really
bad to say about it, go into expecting to get gassed you won't be disappointed. While
writing this entry, listening to the project, it is hard not to like. I am even finding
more to love about each song, lets see what he does next.
