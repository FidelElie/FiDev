I'm just going to come out and say that I love Leven Kali. His music is awesome and he
had easily one of the best Colors performances of last year (I really like tea - I have linked it below).
This song continues with his sound recruiting the wispy vocals of Syd to really make this a
great single. Just waiting for him to release a project, hopefully that will be soon.
