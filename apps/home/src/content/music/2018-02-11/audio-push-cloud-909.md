I learn't about Audio Push last year and and have heard a good few songs that I have liked
of there's like Ghetto Fabulous Filtered Water on their album 90951 and their renditions
of Fade and Caroline on My Turn 3. I gave their newest project a listen and I've got to
admit I am not the biggest fan, it doesn't have much of the structure and I didn't really
like the production on it. The song Status was one of the only songs that stood out to me
on the first listen as I really liked the beat and the vocals I thought meshed well with
the chill vibes. The project wasn't bad just after the first couple listens i'm not sold
we will see if that changes after the next few.
