Firstly, I really like Rae Morris' voice ever since I heard her feature on
:track[2Po4jzwwT1Kaz0xp7Ejojf][Rejjie Snow's Blackst Skn] - which I absolutely love by the
way. So I decided to give her album a listen and although my love for her vocals still remains,
I wasn't the biggest fan of the music. The album overall had me wondering where the structure
was as I couldn't really tell. And with only one stand out song to me after a few blind listens,
this project is just not for me. I might go back and see what her earlier sound is like but
this album is taking a backseat for now.
