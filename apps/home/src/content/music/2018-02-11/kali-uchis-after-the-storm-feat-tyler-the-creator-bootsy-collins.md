Don't have much to say about this song, really like Kali Uchis' vocals, Tyler raps as per
usual and Bootsy Collins is himself, no complaints here. And don't let the haphazard
description deter you from listening, I really do like the song it is just put together
really well, give it a listen and see what you think.
