It may be pretty much the dead of winter in Edinburgh, but this song puts a bit of summer
in the cold. I haven't got round to listening to the Justin's newest album but this song
has his newer sound to it which I really like. I'm definitely going to give the album a
listen to see if the rest of it follows this the lead of this great song.
