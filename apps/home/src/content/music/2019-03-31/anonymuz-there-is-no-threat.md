I've been a solid fan of Anonymuz since returning to his last project Vice City years ago
now. His dark style of rap is very different from what I usually listen to and a welcome
appearance. His production also always slaps in his songs, with strong base signatures and
other elements that add to the unique experience. These themes do continue with his newest
outing, There Is No Threat and I may not like it as much as the last but that doesn't mean
it is not solid. I think I liked how conceptual Vice City was and this led to songs that
told more of a story then what is on this one. From this point I would compare this project
more to his EP :album[73Emr5g9BS6V3vscTiSZd4][Urameshi] than
:album[7N2iWgJi8f2lFPgmGWxmkN][Vice City] as this album is a lot more hype.

The aggression in the production and the delivery is insane. Many of the songs is a one way
trip to getting gassed. And don't get me wrong there are songs that mix it up to. I would
suggest to listen to all his work to be honest, he's making moves and this is just another
ign of the consistency I am seeing. Good shit Anon.
