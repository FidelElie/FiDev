I do like some afrobeats, admittenly it is easy for a lot of it to sound the same. But from
what I have heard from Wizkid he is doing some good. The production does make you want to
skank out to it. I love the how half of the song is in English and the rest in Oruba. The
song flows perfectly between the two. Bucie adds some great vocals to the song. There isn't
anything I really dislike about this song. If I was to nitpick I would say it could be a bit
longer. But other than that this kid is a wiz.
