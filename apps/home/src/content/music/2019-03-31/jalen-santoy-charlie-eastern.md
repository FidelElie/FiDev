I his song Foreplay a while back and I really liked to be honest, the beat bangs and he rides
it really well (Pause?). So I finally got round to giving his last project Charlie Eastern a
listen. And to be honest it is a bit underwhelming. He mentions that he is compared to J.Cole
a lot in the first song, which I can see. But the project itself was a bit boring to me,
there was only one other song on it that stood out to me. And subsequently found its way
onto my playlist.

I guess he was just playing it safe with this project. He needs to some stuff differently
and release something truly unique, maybe then the comparisons will stop.
