Who would have known that the legendary Chaka Khan was going to release something new in 2019
and it be so fire. It had just the right amount of the disco to make you want to dance. Chaka
has still got in spades, with her powerful voice. All the songs are solid with some definite
standouts. The beat-switch in Hello Happiness is an earlier contender for the best beat-switch
sequence of the year. I'm looking forward to seeing what else she has to put out, I'm ready
to dance:

> Take me back to the dance floor, So I can dance away my blues, Love is what I'm here for,
> So don't give me no bad news,
