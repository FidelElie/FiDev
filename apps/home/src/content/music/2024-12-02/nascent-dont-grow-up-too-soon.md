What seems like an age ago in 2021, fresh out of COVID - finally lost the weight from all
the pizza making I did and I found myself at a party with university people i hadn't seen
in about two years. It may have been an :track[1EoHEkVcysf4WVDx6r9WzQ][Over] moment:

:lyrics[
  I know way to many people here right now
  That I didn't know last year who the fuck are yall?
][
  Over:1EoHEkVcysf4WVDx6r9WzQ:Drake
][
  Sorry came to mind - had to do it
]

Jokes aside it was great to see all the familiar faces and catch up - at the time I saw a
music buddy and of course we started talking about what he has listened to and he recommended
me Nascent's earlier album :album[4oP4LxB36ixn9QydAT4Q45][Minus The Bullshit Life's Great]
and I got listening to it. Even up to recently when
I have picked it back up I really liked it so not sure why it never made it into my main
playlist. Luckily for me though I think this new offering is even better.

:quote[Young Mexico - Young Flexico] (that's what he calls himself - don't come for me) is a
producer through and through. All the beats on this are clean and punchy, non of the
transitions are jarring even if he can switch genres with what seems to be every other song.
It stays rooted with rnb or hip hop for the most part with elements of others. Surprisingly,
the song that standouts the most for me is actually the :track[2fBx9NDWSdxk7NZIzJWwqQ][Found You (Outro)],
which could be considered more a skit, but the beat is great and conceptually him having a
conversation with jesus who tells him not to grow up too soon, try new things no matter how
old he gets really resonated with me leading to this being on repeat for me.

The concept doesn't fully extend to the entire album, :track[2s3jEDDokwMlhrhoc5aCnI][Lil Chris (Intro)]
also starts with jesus' very different sermon (it is very entertaining) or the retrospective
:track[12N9VEUrRcRvEOPHAYYYBk][Take Your Time] where Ab Soul reflects on his experiences, but then there
are tracks like :track[3As19hYDpTwkp9Ia2yEqVF][Plata O Plomo (Remix)] that deviate drastically from this.
I do like that song a lot, a great  ignorant hype track to me - it can feel a little out
of place even with the transition being so good between it and the Saba track
:track[2VFgYkEP5RbTxRzVM7i6Cz][U Shoulda Been There (feat. Saba)]. I also think the bonus track
:track[2Li5EVxVHq3yAXBIixJpvK][LONG LIVE DOC] could have just been left off the project, as
I don't think it adds anything and the album should just end with the great outro.

These points do hurt the offering slightly, but not enough to ruin
a great experience that I can recommend with my whole chest. Now excuse me while I go back
and listen to his previous one for at least the tenth time...

:lyrics[
  They say trust the process, don't rush the process
  Take your time
  DON'T GROW UP TOO SOON man
  Keep that imagination, keep that wonder, keep that drive man
  Keep striving to push the envelope and make something new
  Reinvent, keep on creating baby
  You'll never get stale that way
