Let me set the scene for you, I was kicking it with my friend Dre and as I usually do when
I haven't seen him in a while I ask: "Dawg you been listening to anything cool?". At this
point he may as well have shushed me right there and then and said say no more because he
throws this album on the speakers. That was at almost a year ago now and I haven't really
stopped listening to it since.

I had heard Teo before with the song :track[2VRJKXrqR4ztn6WgJ28R9r][In Your Body] which I
liked but this has made me such a fan. I think with album listening especially in my older
age, album starts are so important for building the excitement for a continuous listen and
this album has got it. Not only is the first song a great instrumental but what follows is
an awesome mixture of RnB and trap that in my opinion reaches it's peak with
:track[1LRC7qLxnxvVXjUuna4vHE][Don't Stare Too Long]. The song that follows I also like
a lot with :track[60BliEJiGfhHe0BpcuUVat][Chances], but it is very hard to top the previous
song for me - it is that good.

The album also ends spectacularly as well, I only realised how much I like the 2nd to last
song when returning to the album for this post but it perfectly transitions into a standout
of :track[3OngkUaB9I2J4rGnwrSb6o][Bésame] - which embarrassingly thought was an original
song (thank you to Del for the correction) - but his version is amazing and the perfect end
to twilight the album.

I haven't mentioned the middle as much as personally, I think it is not standout, but just
a solid listen. This shouldn't take away from how much I think you should pick this up.
I thought it was so good that I had to go and listen to his previous album
:album[2cizw1XcPbsvih0hfJ8ydi][Sol] and hopefully you will want to as well once this has
graced your ears.
