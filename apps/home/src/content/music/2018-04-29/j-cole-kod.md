This album was hype to the point where I kept looking at what day it was counting down until
last Friday. What can I say I love me some J.Cole. But then I listened and initially I wasn't
sold on this one.  But with time, I've grown to love J's newest. It is very different from
what he has released previously but important aspects still remain. Great bars - I think
he took his spitting up to 11 in this one - and some great production is still at the
forefront. I also like the a lot more of the hooks from the album then initially thought,
it is a solid album. And always when it comes to J's albums the question is always asked
which one is better so I thought I would put a poll in this post that is before the album
links (swipe on the album cover to reveal it). Personally I am done, with the comparisons.
I have my favorites but what I took from this album is that these bodies of work are so
different from year to year. What he managed to do was keep the consistency that I have
seen since I started listening to him all those years ago. And yes things have got better
over time with J being able to make the music that he wants brought home by what he said
on Born Sinner. He has managed to put across some serious shit with intellect and staying
power that I commend him for. That I can bump his music down the road and be conscious of
the world around me, while not being able to hear the world with music being pumped into
the my ears. And to all those people complaining about his continuation of no features of
his project I have one thing for you:

> [...] How 'bout you listen and never forget?
> I'm only going to say this once, then I'll dip
> Ni**as ain't worthy to be on my shit - makes me smile every time I hear it
-Taken from KOD - KOD

J killed this shit what a great album now I am just waiting for the Fall Off.
