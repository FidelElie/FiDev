I have really liked Miss Harnett's sound since I heard her EP Now in 2014 and this has
continued with her self titled EP in 2016. Regrettably I have to admit I haven't fully got
 around to listening to her latest Project Chapter One but with this song I will definitely
 rectify this. It gives me the same feelings I got from her back then. This song is her at
 its best, the great production and that voice that fits so well with the overall
 instrumentation. It instills a feeling of passion of the listener, she puts a lot of emotion
 into her songs from then and now with this one. It is a great song and I get vibes of her
 previous song If You Let Me from it. I am looking forward to seeing what she does next, keep
 it going Sinead.
