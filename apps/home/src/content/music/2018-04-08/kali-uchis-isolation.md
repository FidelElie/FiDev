This was another surprise, I had no idea Kali was releasing anything this week, but I am
not complaining. There is a lot of differences in this one from jazz to a little bit of
blues - two genres which I absolutely love. And the Hispanic aspects, where she speaks and
sings in Spanish is a nice touch and I don't hear that everyday. I didn't like every song
on it but a good few have found a permanent place on my playlist and I am sure that more will
grow on me with further listens. Another easy recommendation, press play as soon as.
