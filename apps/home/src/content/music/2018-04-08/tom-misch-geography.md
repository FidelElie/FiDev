I was about to flame Tom after my friend Manny told me he released another standalone single
this week. But another friend - shoutouts to Syed - who lives almost a day ahead told me the
"prophecy" that the album I have been waiting for since last year October is finally hear.
I was looking forward to seeing if the wait was worth it. And boy it was. The biggest part
of this groove is the strings. The baselines, the violins and the signature guitar and Misch's
smooth vocals make one of the best vibes I have heard so far this year. It makes you want to
dance listening to the all the riffs and how they mesh so perfectly together. It is a great
album and I am a firm believer that you can wait for greatness, the violins in South of the
River, A nice take on disco with Disco Yes, his great rendition of Stevie Wonder's Isn't She
Lovely? There is so much to love about this album, give it a listen it is definitely worth it.
