It has been a very long time since I have listened to anything from Phony Ppl. Their last album
*Yesterday's Gone* is an exceptional mix of r'n'b, rap and great production. And what seems
like a long hiatus for them, has not changed the style that made the last album so great.
This is a very good summer track to bump in the heat. (There isn't much of a summer in Scotland,
but it is hot somewhere in the world). I like the use of the synths to make the beat, one that
is very dominant and one that bolsters the melody overall. The smooth vocals and rap are
also a very nice touch, that makes it just a solid song. I hope this song is an indicator
for things to come for the group. It's about time that I hear the a *Yesterday's Gone* 2 if
you catch my drift. Give the song a listen, especially if your in denial about summer coming
to a close.

*Listen to Yesterday's Gone* if you haven't already, thank me later.
