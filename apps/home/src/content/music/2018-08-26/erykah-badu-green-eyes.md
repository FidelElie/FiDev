Admittedly I have never got into Erykah Badu. I have blind listened to
:album[3qr4pTBWEU1SVf01j6RAx3][Baduizm] and wasn't completely drawn to it upon first listen.
But after *Olivia* showed me here tiny desk
performance I was immediately drawn to the last song. Like wooow. It has some
great vocals from Erykah and the instrumentation throughout the song is standout. The
brass section on it is both subtle but a powerful edition to the song. The piano, the horns,
the subject matter... The song is about jealousy which I think is very  smart by how it is
portrayed through the song.

The switch ups throughout the song are amazing and are performed remarkably in the Tiny
desk performance (linked below). Me and Olivia thought the later parts of the song were a
jam session exclusive to the T desk performance, and we were happily mistaken. I am definitely
going to listen to :album[4z7ma1ujO4FDL1l2YBGw7b][Mama's Gun] as it is long overdue, and if
it is anything like this song, it will be a winner.
