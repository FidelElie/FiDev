To a surprise to me and what seems like a lot of people on the internet. The Dreamville member
Bas, dropped an album this week and after hearing the song he released earlier on in the week.
*Tribe* with Cole I was very excited to see what Bas's third studio album of would bring,
as the last two were fire. And after the many listens I have given it over the past two days,
I like it. It grows on me with every subsequent listen. When I spoke to Carlos before the
album he did point out that the *Tribe* by nature does sound like a J.Cole song. With both
artists adopting the same *KOD* flow throughout the song. But this does not show though the
rest of the album.

Bas' signature style shines through again in this project with some great production,
vocals and raps. And although this is not as good as *Last Winter* or *Too High To Riot*
it still pretty good in it's own right. I find it that Bas is very unappreciated by him
being the shadow of juggernaut like Cole. With disrespectful shit being said on their
YouTube videos about how Cole is the only reasons to listen to the songs they are both on.
But he is a standout artist in his own right, I love the style he brings to his raps,
the flow is smooth and always easy to follow. He has great bars. And is fucking consistent
and this album proves this even further. Blast off and enjoy Milky Way I sure as hell did.
