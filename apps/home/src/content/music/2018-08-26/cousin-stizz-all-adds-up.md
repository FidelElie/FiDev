In what was another surprise for me, Cousin Stizz decided to release a three song project and....
It is not really my cup of tea. This is not to say that it is inherently bad, I just think
that it sounds like an expansion pack to his last album :album[6GdJPhGu12KSZ7KdgBfye1][One Night Only].
As a result, I found myself being a bit bored after a couple of listens. What is more, is
that the songs (especially :track[5hM2hG4lTZQMlqIWG2usz3][Did It]) incorporated some of the
more bizarre elements of the beats on the album. Which I wasn't the biggest fan of.

It wasn't a bad project and if I hadn't heard his last album maybe I would have liked it more,
but that is just not the case. I would say if you want to get into Stizz listen to some of his previous
stuff, there is a lot more to love there, than here. If you have heard him before don't let
my opinion stop you from at least giving it a listen to see what you think. I'm not a gate-keeper,
just a music listener.
