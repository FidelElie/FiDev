Hooks that are simple and to the point can make or break how good a song can be. And I think
that this song is the perfect example of this, the smooth delivery from the group in an
almost call and response chorus is just too clean. The reason why I emphasize this as the
raps aren't the most standout especially from the album, but I think the bridge to the
chorus really make this song. And let me not forget the jazzy horns throughout the song are
a great touch and elevate this song even more. Give it a listen, one of my favorites from them.
