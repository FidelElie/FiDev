Kanye and his attention seeking makes a lot more sense to me now with all the work he has been
putting in. Production on Pusha T's album :album[07bIdDDe3I3hhWpxU6tuBp][Daytona],
Teyana Taylor's :album[0mwf6u9KVhZDCNVyIi6JuU][K.T.S.E] and working on his own he has been
putting out a lot of stuff over the past month and a bit. And now he releases Kids See Ghosts
teaming up with Kid Cudi, who I am happy to see return. And although I couldn't even sit down
and listen to his last album :album[5bCk3kWAy2JbbTfHqzZCII][Passion, Pain and demon slaying]
I am happy with what I have heard  on this album. His flows and talk are more reminiscent of the
legendary :album[08eM9GRdr5BCCHNqS3Wwud][Man on The Moon II],  but that is definitely not a
bad thing. All of the songs on this 7 song EP (it should be an EP,  it is just below 25 minutes,
oh I love how vague Kanye makes things), sound pretty good.  No terrible sins were made,
there wasn't anything that made me think "What the hell am I listening to?".

But this doesn't mean this is the second coming either, the songs are good but I didn't think
they were great. The production was good, but I don't think it was as good as :album[2Ek1q2haOnxVqhvVKqMvJe][Ye]
or Daytona. The songs are nice and I am happy to say that Cudi's return to music can be considered
a success, and on the Kanye front he has got a few wins over this period. Probably doesn't
make up for the losses incurred though.
