In a surprise to many, Yonce and her so called camel pet decided to release a joint album to
follow their On The Run 2 Tour. And it is not what I expected, If you haven't heard the album
in its entirety, you might have at least seen the Apeshit video. And I think that the flexing
shown and the lyrics perfectly summarize the first three quarters of the album. It is a lot of
hype shit with some seriously great trap beats; both in production and how they get the job done.
The last quarter of the album is more towards just the hip-hop side of things, which I did
enjoy as I think the last two songs on the album were some of my favorites. All this being
said this album however surprising it was, did have some misses. For example, the delivery
of the hook in HEARD ABOUT US:

> If you don't know, now you know ni**aaaaaaaaa,
- taken from HEARD ABOUT US - EVERYTHING IS LOVE

Resulted in more a laughing fit then then some serious acknowledgement. This is offset by
some great lines thought so it is more of a slight misstep than falling of a cliff. Overall
I did like the album it was a change for both of them and they proved that they work so well
together that it doesn't really matter what kind of music they do. They can do it. Everything
is love with this one, well at least mostly.
