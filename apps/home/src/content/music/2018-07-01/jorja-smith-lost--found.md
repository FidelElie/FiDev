Jorja's long awaited album finally hit airs all over the world a couple weeks ago and I gave
only been able to give it a thorough listen recently. And to explain where I stand with it let
me give you two sides of the coin. Firstly my girlfriend Olivia said the it was okay there was
so many songs she had heard before and the few that she did hear were good she supposed, especially
On Your Own, which she showed even before I had listened to the album. And now the other side my friend
Carlos (also known as Dre or Onda in these parts, check out his Soundcloud [here](https://soundcloud.com/ondaldn),
his EP should be dropping soon and it is something to look forward to) and he loves it, just as much
as his undying love for Jorja herself. Slandering aside I think my opinions on this album lie been both
camps, I love the song Olivia showed me and I don't have the problem she has with her knowing a lot of the songs
as Project 11 was one of my only experiences of her music up to this point.c And there is a
lot to love about this album like Carlos said to me when I asked him what I thought about it.
But I would say that to me the album does lose some of its magic towards the end.
So overall it is a good album, some of the songs being the best of what R'n'B has to offer
this year, I am just wondering how long I will be listening to it for.
