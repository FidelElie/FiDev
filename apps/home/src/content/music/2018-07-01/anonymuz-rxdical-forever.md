I have been a fan of Anon's music ever since Vice City and he has been killing it since then.
What it seems like grinding constantly when I see him on Instagram stories he recently released
this. From the first bar:

> Red X on my skin ni**a, this war paint
-taken from Rxdical Forever- Anonymuz

I was gassed and nodding uncontrollably with the crazy production and aggressively delivered
bars. I love how he has carved himself out a distinct style with his music, the darkness
that it holds and I am a very big fan of it. This song brings this point home and is no
exception. Let me summarise this song by sending shots and some of the most disappointing
shit of the year. Fuck A$AP Forever, I'm Rxdical Forever. Amazing tune.
