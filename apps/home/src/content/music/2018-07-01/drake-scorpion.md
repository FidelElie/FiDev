Finally, finally I can say that a Drizzy album since :album[0ptlfJfwGTy0Yvrk14JK1I][If You're Reading This It's To Late]
has been mostly worth the hype it has garnered.... And I stress mostly. The first side of the
album is brilliant like there is so many good songs on it and a lot of good bars from Drake.

He goes in and it has been a long time since I have said that when it comes to drake's discography.
But too bad I cannot say the same for side B. I found it very disappointing overall with
many of the songs being forgettable or just straight boring as I listened. Although Nice
For What is on and March 14 is one of the best songs on the project. But it was a far cry
with some of what is on side A. Side A is almost a masterpiece and with this I had this
thought. I think there should have only been one side and march 14 and nice for what should
have been thrown on to it a few of the trappy songs should have been removed, definitely I'm
upset. And this would have easily been one of the best projects of the year easily.

But what we have is pretty good overall, and I am really happy to say there is a lot to enjoy
about this one. Congrats Drizzy I don't have to be as harsh in my opinions because I think
he has achieved something that is well worth the credit. So now all I have to say is go
take care of your son.

:future-comment[
  Okay tbh there is some more good on this album then I gave it credit for up to now - I
  probably listen to the song Blue Tint more than any other.
  Wouldn't say that this song ends an album though - maybe this was the start of the playlist
  era for Drake?
