This is the first artist that I discovered from Instagram, I have been following this account
called @4thshorehiphop and they do different features of artists, which a large amount to be
from Chicago but I digress. I decided to take a look at her stuff and when they described
her as a vocalist I didn't expect this kind of music. It is R'n'B with more of a jazz flavor
which I always appreciate. With the double bass in Bass Song, the horns I thought she might
be just another forgettable R'n'B artist but I was thankfully proven wrong. I think that
Piano and Bass Song are songs that both encompass this point fully. And the instrumentation
with her voice is a really good combo now I just need to find the time to listen to Act 2.
