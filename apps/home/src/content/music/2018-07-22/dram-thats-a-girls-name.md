It seems like summertime just brings out the funk in everyone. Well at least it has in DRAM
and I am liking what I hear. I think his style is great for music like this, from the flow
to the voice when singing and rapping. It was a perfect fit on Calvin Harris'
:album[2HaqChIDc5go3qxVunBDK0][Funk Wav Bounces Vol.1] and it fits perfectly hear as well.
It even has an old school feel in places with some of the samples that were used in the project
which I always appreciate. But DRAM brings it all together with these songs, he is a very
talented individual and it resulted in this, some great summer songs. He definitely Does.
Real. Ass. Music (needed to slot that in here somehow).
