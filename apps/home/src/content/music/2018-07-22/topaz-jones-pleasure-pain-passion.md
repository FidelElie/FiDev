Since Yung Cangz (shoutouts to her) showed me this song earlier this week I have had it on repeat.
I have never been a big fan of Topaz Jones, his songs Tropicana was OK and his last project
was very mediocre. But this song is something else. Super funky, I think what I love most
about the song, other than the instrumental is the delivery of the vocals from Jones.
As well as the bars from KAMAU, the hook is definitely my favorite bit of the song but he
contributes a lot with his bars. There not even anything amazing but it fits the song
perfectly. and I do love a couple of the lines. The song makes me want to sing along, it
makes me want to dance. Great song hopefully his eventual project will follow suit.
