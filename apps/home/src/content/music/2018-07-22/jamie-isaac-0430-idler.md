I'm stuck right here again (Find Your Words) listening to a Jamie Isaac album and thinking,
this guy has some talent. I loved how he uses the piano throughout his music. In the last
project he used it to convey a much more somber tone and in this one it is still somber,
but more upbeat and positive at the same time. This is shown by the piano not being in the
forefront as much. Whereas in the last album I think that was what made it for me. There is
the drums on Maybe and the synths in many of the songs are a great touch with Jamie's voice
bringing it all home. The reverb is a lot more wet in these songs which I thought could
detract from the songs in places but all in all I am very happy with what I have heard.
