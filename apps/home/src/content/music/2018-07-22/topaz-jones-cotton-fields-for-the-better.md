So off the high note that is :track[1JrGI3oftzTr3V6d32LIb0][Pleasure Pain Passion]. I decided
to listen to some more from Jones because I think he definitely deserves my attention. And
this two song project gives me evidence that supports that the super funk sound that he has
adopted is here to stay. :track[5zNh0eTYFaz8gtn2QEPZfF][Cotton Fields] is my favorite song
from the funky ass beat to Jones' delivery it is just a solid song.

 I do like :track[2I18Vrx8XAuIt2l6uFxb1p][For The Better]. I think that the production of this song
left a little more to be desired in its entirety. This is due to the fact that the different
aspects that make the beat: the kick, the sample don't hit hard enough for me personally.
But I am happy with what I am have been hearing from him this year. I'm now looking forward
to his next project, when that will be.

  No pain no gain that's a new lesson,
