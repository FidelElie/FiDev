With all that's is going on with Kanye at this time. All the attention seeking as promo for
his weekly album release we got ye, his lone 7 song project that is mean't to be a masterpiece.
And it is...... Okay, nothing to really write home about as a whole body of work. The first
song is one I like as it, but I'm not a big fan of the switch up in it. His whole spiel about
loving himself was amusing and made me grow to like it overall but then the rest of the album
was forgettable to me except for the last song. Which single-handedly, brings the project up
a few notches for me. It is one of my favorite songs of the year so far, almost a masterpiece
in my eyes. If you listen to any of this project listen to that song. It almost brings me
back to a time of my favorite Kanye song (Heard Em Say for anyone asking ) and that is a feat
in itself. So to summarize this song is the best I have heard from Kanye in a while, I wish
his publicity stunts were for a better album though.
