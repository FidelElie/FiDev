I didn't even know Gambino was releasing anything, so thank you to Olivia for putting me on
to it. This two song project summed up is a miss then a hit for me. I am surprised he didn't
release a project called Kauai Part 2 when I first listened to Summertime Magic. The beat
fell in line with that style that Gambino showed then and I can't say I liked it that much.
The beat had what sounded like a heavily produced fart in it and his vocals didn't do much
for me in this song. However Feels Like Summer is a different story. The beat is great, I
think the vocals are much better for this song, fits it a lot more does not sound tact on.
When he hits the high note, ooooo it's pretty lit and I will probably find this song in my
rotation for the summer. Super chill tunes and the best one on the pack. Great song, I wonder
if he is going to release Kauai Part 2 at some point.
