As love or hate as his last album could of been for some, I have got to admit that he can
make some great tunes. This song is definitely one of them, the hook performed by Miguel:

> All of my bitches got friends
> - taken from Got Friends featuring Miguel

And Goldlink's forever groovy flow leads to a great song and I'm hoping that it will lead
to a great project down the road.
