I've liked a few Jay Prince songs in the past (Where You Belong is great) and but after listening
to his most recent album Late Summers, I was really sold on him. His two follow a single
distinct sound. They both possess the really hard kicks that are found throughout the lovely
world of trap music. And both songs follow this blueprint, in the morning to less of an extent,
with this possessing more a dance vibe to it.

Personally I do like the former more than the latter. When it comes to the trap that I listen
to these days I really need more than just a hard beat to keep me listening, I need some
bars and Jay did not really bring this on Motion. whereas In The Morning is a lot more
lighthearted, fun track that I can listen to without a care in the world. It has made me
want to go back and listen late summers again, until then in the morning will be in the
rotation.
