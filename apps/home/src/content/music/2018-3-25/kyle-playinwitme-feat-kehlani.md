The Feel Good King enlisted Miss Kehlani to bring a nice song all in all. The best was not
very noteworthy to me but I do like the chemistry that the two artists show in the vocals.
I've always liked Kehlani's voice and some of her music (Cloud 19 is great) and KYLE's Smyle
is one of the most positive albums probably ever created. They go well together and this
song shows that. Solid song, bring on more tunes.
