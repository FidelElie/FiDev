I am all for giving artists a second chance when they fuck up, and especially for Logic an
artist I hold dear I might be even more lenient. So when I saw the biracial boy (sorry
can't help it sometimes) released a new song. I was urged myself to give it a listen. It
is.... Ok I guess, It is more a pop-off hype tune, more down the lines of what was heard
on his project Bobby Tarantino. I like it, I just don't think it is something to write home
about.
