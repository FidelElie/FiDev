Dre put me on to this and it has been on straight repeat for me. Where do I start with this
well the first part has an amazing beat, sampled from a song that is familiar but I can't
put my finger on, so if you recognize it let me know. This is the first song I've heard
Kojey Radical's bars and I've got to say he goes in:

> Can I speak to god, will god ever speak back, she might be busy me too, I'll just have
> to face the facts.  If the crown fits wear it, when they're ready they'll take it back.
-from Mad About Bars

This is the first 20 seconds of the song and the flow switch in the middle of the first part
was just the icing on the cake. I am definitely going to go back and listen to his project
form last year, and will look out for this other stuff. The only problems with this single
is I am not the biggest fan of the second part, but I believe that is only because of how
good the first part is. In addition, it is only available on Spotify as it is a Spotify
special which is not a problem for me, but I do believe exclusive music sucks so thought i
would mention that as well. As a result I dropped the YouTube video for this one in the article
too, so swipe to listen, I love it and I hope you do too.

> Silly me, thinking I can change the world in a heartbeat, poem after poem hoping they
> would let my art speak.
-Love this thought I would quote some more sauce, it keeps coming with this one.
