A vunique voice and sound is what Poppy brings to the table. I have been
following her since I stumbled across some of her earlier singles and I am super
happy with this project. It has a very whimsical sound that whisks you off to another world
as the EP progresses, and this is brought home by the vocals she provides. It is a great
project I just want to see something bigger from her now, an album maybe? I'll be keeping
an eye out.
