It's Dolph!!! But I do have mixed feelings about this late entry to this week's roundup, I
decided to listen to it at 1 in the morning why editing photos and I was bopping to this
throughout the early morning. If you liked bulletproof you'll probably like this its just
more of the same. More Dolph. That is if you turn off your brain off for abit as there are
some suspect bars in this, that when I let the infectious beats pass I was like what???

> Drop a pill in her drink like Bill (whoa)
> - like huh?????
> - from Slave Owner - N****s Get Shot Everyday

I do not cosign these bars, how it was allowed to leave the studio is beyond me. So on whole
I'm like eww but excluding this song, its just the same Dolph, nothing more nothing less.
Probably wont be talking about it at the end of the year but its ok for now.
