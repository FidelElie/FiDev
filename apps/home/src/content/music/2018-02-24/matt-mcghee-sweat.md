Mentioned in an earlier week, I've been listening to more of Matt thought I would give this
song a mention. It is party-esque with its up beat tempo and just funky feel has some serious
GoldLink vibes to it. His rides the beat as well as GoldLink does in this song as well.
This song is definitely a good vibe and Ill be keeping an eye out for what he puts out next.
Give this a listen and I embedded the colors show performance so swipe to see that if the
streaming services aren't really your speed.
