This is definitely a throwback to my sixth form days (16 to 18) years old - about a decade ago
(God I'm old). I never knew what genres to categorise Bad Rabbits as, according to their
Spotify bio:

:lyrics[
  "The hardest R&B act on the planet" Salim. Dua. Sheel. Est 2007 in Boston MA
][Bad Rabbits Spotify Biography]

Maybe this R&B is what their new music is firmly grounded in but this wasn't the case for
their older stuff. They were a truly genre bending band and that is probably why I love them
so much. I could talk about a lot of their albums - especially :album[3daJ4FTEqKuweMmNMztey8][American Love]
(I probably will at some point). But I found myself drawn back to Stick Up Kids recently,
mostly due to their Audiotree live set. A perfect illustration of how good this band is, from
the vocals to the instrumentation (linked below). But it is the funky beats, with a great
band that keeps me coming back, to this project.

Case in point: the last bit of the title song :track[5E49goNw1yOQeYvbKiV8Qg][Stick Up Kids]
always gives me chills. I think its just that good. Maybe its nostalgia, maybe my ears haven't
grown much since then - but I think this has always a winner and there is only one way for you
guys to find out - isn't there.
