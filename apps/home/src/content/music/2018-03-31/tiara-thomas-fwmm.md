I don't really like comparing artist to each other but to me Tiara.... Sounds a bit like a
bootleg H.E.R. The biggest problem with this is not that the vocals sound like her but her
sound is just H.E.R. And it doesn't bring anything different to the table, leading to a very
boring listen overall. There wasn't really a song that stood out to me over the listen. But
I guess the whole experience was not insulting to me, so that is something. I wouldn't give
this a sweeping recommendation by any means, but I know that everyone is different so you might
take more from H.E.R than I did. I will give her earlier EP a listen however, because I do
like her vocals and her sound, I'm just hoping that it is a bit more unique.
