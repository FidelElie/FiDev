I just want to start this off by saying for the people who know me, they know me and Abel
are not really on the same page. I'm not the biggest fan of his music and I'm not going to
go as far as to say he is over rated - he is definitely talented. But I've never got into
him like some of the people who I know. This being said I came into this project with an
open mind and I've got to say I'm on the fence. It is OK, he is just upset crying about
Selena, Bella or both who knows. I have heard a lot better on Beauty Behind The Madness at
least. But I should give this a few more listen before I make my full judgement, maybe Abel
will grow on me in this situation.
