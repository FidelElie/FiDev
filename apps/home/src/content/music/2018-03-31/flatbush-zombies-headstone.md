I've got one name to say and that is Meechy Darko, I loved his vocals since I head Flatbush
years ago and this hasn't changed. What he bought to :track[1vpQmfAJWRAFsvBHtAy0d9][RING THE ALARM]
on joey's album was something serious and that continues on Headstone. The others also bring
the heat to this hype tune in their raps as well. It has easily earned the latest spot on
my gassed playlist and hopefully this means that their next project is going to be fire too.
