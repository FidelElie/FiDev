This is song that definitely gets better with time. And I don't mean over listen but as the
song progresses it turns into a song that is pretty mediocre to one that I really liked.
This comes from the fact that all the instruments only make their presence known later on in the song.
The strings make the song for me and only come in when Logic starts to wrap for the second time.
And by the end of the song the composition sounds like an orchestral piece with Sam flexing
his vocal prowess at this point too. The song is pretty good overall and if you can get past
the first bit of it, there is definitely a lot to like.
