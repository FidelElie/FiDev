It's great to hear some new R&B, especially when it is this good. He follows a sound that I
think the new age R&B artists do so well. It makes a lot of sense to me that SiR and Ty feature
on this album because their styles mesh so well with the project's great production and vocals.
It is also like he paying homage to the artist who feature on the album as each of the songs
have elements that fit with each artist. The jumpy nature of Fuck Y'all, that has SiR
written all over it. Or the song Take fitting Ty's vocals perfectly.  And YG's raps in the
heavier We Ain't Homies,  there is so much to love about this album. It also doesn't need
these features to shine either, his voice will carry you through . Shout outs to Dre for
putting me on to this, couldn't recommend this enough. Give it a listen when you have the
chance.
