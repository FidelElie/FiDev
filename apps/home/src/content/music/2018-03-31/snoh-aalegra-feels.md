I Stumbled across this artist and her album when I glanced the related artists for Arin Ray
and I am so glad I clicked on her profile. She loves the rain apparently (at least that
is what it says in her bio) and I do think this comes across in her music. The rain is not
a particularly sad thing by nature, depending true where you are it can be god send - Cali
always being a drought comes to mind. This fact is personified in her music where I think
she finds a balance between the somber and more energetic sounds to make something unique
and refreshing. This point is bought home by the feature where rappers like Vic, Vince and
Logic slow it down and just ride with what this girl is bringing. At least nice things come
out of going to the library, other than getting work done of course.
