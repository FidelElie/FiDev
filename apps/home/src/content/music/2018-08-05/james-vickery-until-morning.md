There is a lot to love about this song, I wouldn't agree with what my friend Jesse says,
that the first bit sounds like something from Boyz II Men. There isn't really any of the
harmonies that make a Boyz II Men song just that, theirs. But I can see how he could of
thought that, the note held at the start is very impressive. And is an amazing way to
start off the song. Which leads into some really slow and sensual R'n'B music. This guy
can sing, and this is what brings the song home, with it being a very solid modern R'n'b
song, which pays homage to those that came before it. Give it a listen and see what you
think.
