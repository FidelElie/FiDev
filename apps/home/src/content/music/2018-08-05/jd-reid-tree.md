In the upcoming podcast episode, Carlos told me about this project and it piqued my interest,
so I thought I would give it a listen. J.D is a producer and he is cooking on these beats.
Like a flaming pot with every beat having a distinct vibe to it. Some jazz, some grime and
some hip hop all with him adding his own flavor to them.

The only thing I thought missed the mark sometimes on the album was some of the features.
For me there are some familiar faces on it, as well as some new people who fit the bill.
But I think that some of them don't do the beats justice. But then I can still listen to
the amazing instrumentals. Solid project and it has resulted in a new artist on my radar.
