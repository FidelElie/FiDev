After being nagged and hearing from a lot of people to listen to this project, I have finally
found the opportunity to sit down and give it a good listen. And I've got to say it is some
of the best stuff of the year s0 far. All of the group pull their weight in this album, to
make it what it is, amazing. Syd providing some amazing vocals as well Matt Martians and Steve
Lacy giving their backing as well as playing the keys and guitar. Patrick Paige II and
Christopher Smith on the bass and the drums. Allowing yourself to hone in on each aspects
that makes up the song, and realising what each does for the it..... Long story short it
makes every song a winner, I can't think of any song on the album that I disliked, they
are all stand out and thus make this album standout. Don't do a Fiddy and take ages to
listen to this one, it is worth listening to a thousand times and more. Highly recommended.
