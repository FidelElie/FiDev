Carlos showed me this artist during gaming session a while back and after looking back
through my playlist. I just had to give her a shout out. Where should I start with this song?
Is it the old school but rocking groove? Is the artist vocals and flow? Or is it the upbeat
and positively flexing lyrics? I think it is a combination of all three and I find myself
hooked. She is really cool and although Carlos said he wasn't really feeling her previous
project, I see myself giving it a chance eventually, almost solely based on this song, yes
it is that fire.
