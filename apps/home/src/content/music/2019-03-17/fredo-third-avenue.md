The man is from down the road from me in London, so I guess I had to like this album through
fear of getting shanked. All jokes aside this album left me with mixed feelings. On the one
hand, I like Fredo rapping, a good amount of the bars are not about killing people either.
But some of the others left me feeling kind of dirty. For example:

> The first time I poked someone up, I can't lie he was a neeky yute But he was
>  So I felt like I just needed to
- Taken from Third Avenue

It's lyrics like this just have me thinking "Damn this guy sounds a bit like a Chicago drill
rapper, all death and little no substance" (Except like Herbo or Bibby). But he does show some
flair in places in the album. Talking about how school wasn't for him, apologising to his mum.
It is an album of twists and turns for me, rapper like this always leave me with mixed emotions,
if the songs sound good. Maybe it was the production all along I am not sure, I just don't want
to get poked. Good stuff Fred, lets see what else you do.
