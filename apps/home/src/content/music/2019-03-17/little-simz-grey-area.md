It is a contender, Simz brings the fire as always that hasn't changed but the the album is
fire and I cannot get enough of the tunes. Simz has bars for days, there are so many
standout songs on this album, that I could almost put the entire album in the favourite
songs section. The fucking features (excuse my french but it is needed for emphasis here)
are used so well. Chronixx, Kiwanuka, Cleo and Little Dragon do some justice on their
tracks and just round out this purely glorious album. To make it an early contender
for me this year.

I heard a lot of the singles before this but it didn't prepare me for the vibe, so I will
try and prepare you with this entry. Listen to it and get ready, you're in for a treat.
And for a taster check out her Color's performance of Venom down below just to wet your
appetite.
