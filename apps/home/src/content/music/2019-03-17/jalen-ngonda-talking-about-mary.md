This EP may have been released in this year, but i sounds like something straight from 60
years ago. He has a style that reminds me of Leon Bridges' first album Coming Home. However,
this is not to take away from Jalen's talents, the man can sing and it does lead to this 4
song EP being a trip down memory lane for the old music I have listened to over year.

I really do enjoy seeing modern artists, adopting a sound of old, it just shows how timeless
these sounds are. I only found his music recently and I am very intrigued to see what he does
next. Singles is not going to be enough, the proving ground will be a bigger project for me.
I will be listening to this project though.
