I recently had a massive [Colors Show](https://www.youtube.com/@COLORSxSTUDIOS) binge in
one of my procrastination sessions recently. I find myself really giving a lot more people
a chance. Whether they were people I dismissed because of how they looked, or the descriptions
of their sound I got on Instagram, or if I just missed their performances altogether. The
last point describes this performance for me.

I was taken aback by his powerful voice, and smooth as hell R'n'B, the song lyrics were
also cool. It was anything very profound or fake-deep or even overly romantic. It was
just realistic which I respect, you can tell the song was written straight from experience
and I cant be mad at that. I will be seeing what else he has put out, hopefully it is as
good as this one.
