Admittedly, I slept on this album quite a bit when it initially when it came out. I was very
hype for it, PJ Morton's last album :album[1CkM9RhnkW6Ds3wDTheOdo][New Orleans] was amazing
to me, like ridiculously good, the subject matter, the lot of it. However, when I listened
to Gumbo; I wasn't really drawn to it initially. I'm not sure why either, it just didn't
have the same pull that the first one had. So I saved a couple of songs and never went back
to it.

This all changed when I found myself listening deep into my main playlist and stumbled
across the song :track[1nR45hPphraeLSO5utjH7T][Claustrophobic] again. The horns, his talk
about labels trying to fit you into a box, made for a great song:

:lyrics[
  But I must admit, I'm claustrophobic
  I have a hard time trying to fit into your small mind
  And I have a habit of dreaming bigger than anything
  I can see right in front of me
][Claustrophobic:1nR45hPphraeLSO5utjH7T]

So I went back to listen to the album. Story time aside, I do not know what I was thinking
back then. This album is awesome. It has the right amount of features on it, it is not too
long, the songs flow perfectly and they sound great too.

Admittedly, my change of heart can also be credited to listening to the live rendition of
the album (check it out below). But, the studio version definitely holds its own and I am
happy that I gave it a chance again.
