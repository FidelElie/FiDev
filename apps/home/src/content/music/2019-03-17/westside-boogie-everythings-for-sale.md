I guess I could say the writing was on the wall with this album. I had heard from a few people -
including Carlos who had told me multiple times - that Boogie was fire. And after listening to
his debut album I have to agree, to at least an extent. I really enjoyed most of what I heard
from it. His style marries the two camps of music together, with his more R'n'B focussed tracks
and more Hip Hop oriented. And yes this has been done countless times before him, but there
is a difference between doing things for the sake of it and doing them well. The Boogie he brings
to the table adds a unique aspects to the songs.

The only problem I had with the album is that all song may be solid. But there is only a
few standout songs that I find myself going back to, and have subsequently found their way
into my playlist. That being said this doesn't take away from the album as a whole and it
is still an amazing outing for the artist. Give it a listen, see what you think.
