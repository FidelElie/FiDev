When I first heard Michael Kiwanuka's Love and Hate on the radio and subsequently gave his
album a listen. It was almost a life changing experience to here this man's style in his songs.
The album tells a story that I just love to hear again and again. So when I heard him on
Simz album and found myself on his Spotify page with something 'new' to listen to, I was
excited. I say 'new' because this album is a live performance of songs I have heard before
in Love and Hate. In addition, to the performance unlike PJ Morton's - Gumbo Unplugged
(I linked it before and I will link it again it is great) being quite different from the
Studio album, this is a very similar experience, just a live one.
