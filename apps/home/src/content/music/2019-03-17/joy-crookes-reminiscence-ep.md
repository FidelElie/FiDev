This is not Joy's first outing on Music Weekly, and to start off it is not her best either.
But, I was too quick to judge this project on first listen, because when I finally got round
to the second... There is so much to like about the songs on offer. It's not about her coming
into her own or anything, I just needed to sit down and actually listen to them. The first
too song are so flames, I can't even really do them justice, I like everything about them.
And the others though they didn't have me like "Yo" are good as well. Maybe I'm just
annoyed wondering where the album is at.

I think I have a bit of EP fatigue, of which I will mostly blame Kanye for his 7 track
bonanza not too long ago. But I shouldn't let this feeling take away from this project
being a great listen overall. To summarise, not as good as her last, but no slouch
either, just release something bigger.
