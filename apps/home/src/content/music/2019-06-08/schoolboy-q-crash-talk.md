I just realised how consistent how Q has been. All the albums up to this one have been great,
with personally the peak being his previous Blank Face LP. Has this consistency continued
with CrasH Talk? I think it has for very different reasons than the others that I have
listened to. Where Oxymoron and Blank Face had the tendency to make me think a bit more
about what is being said. CrasH Talk just gets me gassed. Simple as that.

The songs on this are at their most fire when they make me want to go to the gym and lift
the heaviest weight I can. The good think for the album is that a lot of the songs are like
this. And for some of my favourites, I think it some of the best of this year for this type
of music. I may have not liked the album initially, but it has grown on me and for you might
just skip that step, because there is a lot to like. Just know what you are in for.
