I didn't even know these two did a collaboration, but I'm feeling it, they fit really well
together. The piano at the forefront of the beat, the vocals provided by Uncle Sego for the
hook. The rapping and singing contributed by Boogie leads to a very chill track. This is
all while telling the story of something that is far from chill. It is a great listen,
that I have been listening to on repeat for a good few weeks now. I would love to see them
collab again, I would think that fire would ensue once more.
