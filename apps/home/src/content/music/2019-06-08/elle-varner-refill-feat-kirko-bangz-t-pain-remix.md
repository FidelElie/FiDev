I have a little bit of a stigma when it comes to remixes. Some are just rip offs of the the
original song. Removing the original essence of the song, so what is the point of listening
to it. Some are take most of what the song does great and puts it to a random beat. Some have
artist who have no business being on the original song hopping on and giving it a shot. And
some are actually pretty good. Unfortunately for the remix of Refill(Which is one of my
favourites off of Perfectly Imperfect) this falls into the third category.

Firstly, I love T Pain, and he is not the offending artist in this case as his contribution
I think doesn't take away from the song at all or as much as Kirko Bangz. He just doesn't
fit the song to me, he just sounds trash on it thats all. Elle's bit is great as usual,
but if I wanted to listen to that, I would just listen to the original. Better yet that
is what I am going to continue doing, too much bad auto tune on this one not even Mr Pain
can save it.
