I wanted to like this album, funnily enough initially I didn't even like the previous album
:album[6wjryxtrKxzTZID9kyZUV5][Yesterday's Gone] but I grew to absolutely love it. With me
approaching multiple listens of this album however I have got say, I am disappointed. Not
that the songs are bad, I feel that some are boring and the others are okay at best. The
only song I can say that I have had on repeat is Ice Water and this is the only song that
I liked on the album that was not previously released as a single.

I'm honestly a bit bent out of shape about this project, it is so meh to me that it is almost
offensive. It is not trash, I just expect so much from Loyle that maybe my expectation were
too high. I am employ you to listen for yourself and tell me if I am talking shit, maybe
then I'll give it to a listen again. Until then you can find me on
:track[2YQ1cc9xWnp5qI08rKt6wv][Isle Of Arran].
