Over the years of using Spotify, I have found that a very efficient way to find someone you
like is to go a artist you currently like and have a look at the related artists. You usually
find yourself looking at the artists and thinking what music do they make. But in the case of
Leon Thomas I was drawn by more than just the possibility of great music. He looked weirdly
familiar, turns out I he is also a actor in HBO show insecure so I didn't thankfully confuse
him with just another black guy.

The recognition aside is his music any good? Well with the fact that he only wears white wife
treaters in the show, I should have known he was an R&B artist. And luckily his music is
definitely worth listening to it. It definitely has that new age R&B sound that I appreciate
from the likes of Arin Ray or SiR but with a more upbeat tone to the whole project that
I can enjoy. The instrumentation is good with guitars hard hitting drums and horns and
Leon can sing. So it is a thumbs up from me.
