I do hate it when it seems an artist you was rooting for just disappears of the face of the
planet for a while. No word of even an EP or accidentally stumbling across one of their projects
on Hot New Hip Hop amongst all the other trash. Nothing but a couple of singles that you new nothing about.
Well I wasn't having it, I would not let the drought win and so for Elle I went back and listened
to her last album. Perfectly Imperfect is an awesome album and makes me quite annoyed that I
have been waiting 7 years for something to attempt to top it.

Firstly, Varner has a stellar voice, like really good. You could almost say that her music
is almost carried by it. This is not to say that the instrumentation is lacking, but that
it becomes that much more memorable with her singing over it. The typical R&B themes are
here but here voice brings it home, from front to back. Now i just hope that greatness
truly awaits for her next one. Until then give this oldie but goodie a listen.
