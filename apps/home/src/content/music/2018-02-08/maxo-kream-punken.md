A friend told me give this guy a listen and I'm not going to lie I  was skeptical at first but he was pretty cool. His trapp style is complimented by the fact that he is not a mumble rapper. It definitely not lyrical. Alot of the album follows his change to the trap artist he is now which is a nice change i guess. I didn't like all the songs on it but the ones where the production turns up to 2000 percent I was rocking with. So I would at least say give it a listen see what you think.
