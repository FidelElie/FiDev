Was making cheesecake (so a normal Monday night) at a friend's house and he put this on.
I was like "What is this fire?", he told me and then I asked him to message me with the name
so I don't forget. "He was like yeah yeah cool will do", then subsequently didn't . So
after chasing him up on it I have been listening to this song a lot. It is great just to
get a bit gassed on Nasty C's flow switch up and the beat hits too hard. It has easily
earned it's place on the gassed playlist.
