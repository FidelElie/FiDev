What can I say about this album. Well it is long and in this case that is not a good thing.
I have a policy of doing a blind listen of an album the first time around, meaning no looking
at the song changes, just listening through without interruption. If there is a song of note
then I will have a look at what it is called. That never happened with Culture II, partly
due to me not even knowing when a new song was on. I am pretty disappointed with the newest
project from them, considering :album[4JTOxuvM2jcSqAvEZtZsOO][Culture 1] was so good. The
songs hit harder they actually had bars that were at least memorable:

:lyrics[
  Put a model bitch on coco
  Told her read between the lines
][
  Call Casting:4BqE5Rg3r4Rtizvm3IicrN
]

Compared to some of the bars from this one being memorable for all the wrong reasons.

:lyrics[
  Diamonds (diamonds) on my wrist look like a McFlurry??????
][
  Emoji A Chain:0G9rmRmQDFk9O2tzZLyRkc
][
  I added the question marks but maybe they should have actually been in the lyrics because
  what the fuck???? I guess because a McFlurry is cold - anyway it sucks
]

To me the project just feels like a lot of swag rapping that doesn't make much sense. It is
travesty when I hear new Migos and none of it finds its way onto my Gassed playlist. I''ll
give it a few more listens because it is for the culture after all but its not looking great
at the moment.
