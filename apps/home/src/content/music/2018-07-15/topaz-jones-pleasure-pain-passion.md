Since Yung Cangz (shout outs to her) showed me this song earlier this week I have had it on repeat.
I have never been a big fan of Topaz Jones, his songs :track[55IuU6L7o7kOGcvH5eP43u][Tropicana]
was OK and his last project :album[7kfejHBETR7u8V9s2EPN5x][Arcade] was very mediocre. But
this song is something else. Super funky, I think what I love most about the song, other than
the instrumental is the delivery of the vocals from Jones. As well as the bars from KAMAU,
the hook is definitely my favorite bit of the song but he contributes a lot with his bars.
There not even anything amazing but it fits the song perfectly. and I do love a couple of
the lines. The song makes me want to  sing along, it makes me want to dance. Great song
hopefully his eventual project will follow suit.
