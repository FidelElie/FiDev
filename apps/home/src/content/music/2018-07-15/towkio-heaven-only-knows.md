When listening to Eryn Allen Kane's :album[7sVyk1fdhhiBcguh15NN3N][Aviary: Act 1] I realised
she was the artist that was featured on my  favorite Towkio song and after giving it a listen
again I thought I would feature it. Incorporating what is also my favorite John Legend song
:track[5FwI5cOOdRaeEXANAv4dPJ][Heaven] into the lyrics and again the delivery of it is what
sells it to me. Its almost like a new-age choir bolstered by Eryn's vocals. And Chance is
just Chance the rapper there isn't much else to say. I love this song and I'm happy that I
realized a bit more about it. A solid song and I am happy that I had the chance to learn t
hat there was an artist I never noticed on it.
