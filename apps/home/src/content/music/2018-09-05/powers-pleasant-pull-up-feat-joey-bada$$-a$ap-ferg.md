This song holds a special place in my heart. I didn’t even know this was released onto I
happened to stumble onto Joey’s Spotify page and I was waiting for it to drop in for ages.
Almost a a whole 10 months since I got to hear it for the first time at his gig last October

The song still has the great “Pull Up” feel to it. It gets me gassed hearing the hook and
Joey’s bits but I think overall it heard the magic that I heard that night. It was an amazing
night all things considered. But Ferg’s contribution to the song, although not terrible,
does hurt the song overall as it is just alright.

This results in a song that could be better and maybe it was the power of the live performance
or the power of the night but I was feeling this song a lot more 10 months ago. It is still
cool though, my gassed playlist has got a new member, but I’m kinda wish I got to recording
at this point back in October.
