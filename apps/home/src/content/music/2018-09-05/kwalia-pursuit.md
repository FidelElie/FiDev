Jordan Rakei and a classical composer Richard Melkonian forming the collaboration Kwalia.
Providing me with a sound in Pursuit that I never thought I wanted or needed. The
instrumentation on the three song project is an amazing experience. Overall the best that
I have heard this week for being unique and more meaningful than a lot of the music I have
heard as of late.

Jordan contributes minimal amounts of vocals to the songs. However, this is one of those
instances where less is more. His voice fits these songs perfectly and rounds
out this great duos' first outing. Give it a listen, I hope they release more together under
the Kwalia banner.
