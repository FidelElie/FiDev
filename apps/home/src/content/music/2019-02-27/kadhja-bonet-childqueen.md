I first heard Kadhja's colours performance and was intrigued, so I thought I would give her
album a listen and to say the least I wasn't ready for the experience. The song that was
performed on Colours Show - Delphine was only the tip of the iceberg. Her music is quite
genre bending to me, taking aspects from many to make a sound that is both unique and welcome.
Her singing style also contributes to this fact, it is very smooth and fits the style of her
music perfectly.

This album brings these points across quite well (Her previous project does so too), with a
good array of songs ranging from slower more thoughtful songs like the previously mentioned
Delphine to the more upbeat Mother Maybe it is a varied and great listen. It did take some
time to grow on me, and for me to realise the draw. I still don't know what I think about
some of the instrumentation choices towards the end of Another Time Lover but overall I
really like what she is doing. I looking forward to what she does next.
