This came out earlier in 2018 and when my friend Carlos told me that this was amazing I
have to admit I was skeptical at first. I had listened to the odd JMSN song beforehand, but
was never drawn in by them. This all changed with this project, boy was he right about it
being one of the best R&B albums of the year. This man can sing and initially you would think
I would just be talking about his vocal range, but no it is much more. The delivery he brings
to every song, to add such a funky flavour and then switch it up at a moments notice. Makes the
album very interesting and enjoyable to listen to and a favorite of mine for a large portion of
last year. If you've been looking for some R&B to listen to this could be what you're looking
for.
