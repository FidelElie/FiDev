This song makes me want to go home, just so I can listen to it in its context. I got to hear
this live at Kojey's concert and I did not know what this song was then. But it was amazing
then and it is definitely now. This is the first song I know of that I have experienced Swindle's
production and in this song it is stellar. The horns (God I love horns) and the really distinct
percussion are ridiculously good. Kojey, kills the song too with his raps as well as the vocals
for the hook. The song almost forces me to sing along, even in situation where this is not
permitted (Do you guys think people would mind, if I burst into song in the library? Probably).
This song has been on repeat ever since I managed to find it on Spotify, give it a listen whether
you're going home or otherwise.
