This seems like a very polarising pick. Some people weren't
really feeling it, even long running fans of Paak. But for me this is the first instance
of a project from the great Paak that has actually cemented me as a fan of his. I always
knew he was a great musician and I did like :album[6xNFuLOko8gjxi5kUAyGyM][Malibu] (I
haven't actually got round to listening to :album[2Wl2eLBIbjAt6AZwd07IxG][Venice] as of yet),
but I have been feeling this album and many of the songs on it.

There is something to be said about the man's style he brings to his songs, the
instrumentation that comes with it and the comic relief that just happened to be a part of
this project too, made for a good listen to me. It is far from a perfect album, I am a
firm believer that the last song on the album :track[5sEKWiSjsWKsmV9IOvYKhD][Left To Right] -
whether it was a bonus track or not - was one of the worst songs I have heard all year. But
this is just a droplet in a puddle which contains songs like :track[1eMWxSLN7rDSDSrvKSj8gS][Sweet Chick],
:track[4qNijbGeHqlcFWrGrATFOX][Cheers], :track[2lRe5wBRm4xaSKTbDn2vLD][Trippy], the list could
go on. It is a solid album and I will more than likely be listening to the songs
on offer for years to come. So for skeptics and those who haven't got round to listening to
this one: come meet me in the middle.
