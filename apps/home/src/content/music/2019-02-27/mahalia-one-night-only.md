I like what I have heard of Mahalia with songs like Sober but this song definitely increased
this feeling significantly, the strings, her smooth vocals, Kojey's smooth vocals, a lot of
smooth vocals make this song for me. The raps are great too, it is just a solid song not sure
what else to say other than I'm probably going to go and listen to her most recent EP.
After listening this song you probably should too, what a vibe.
