I like what I have heard of Mahalia with songs like :track[3C57ewlHARCVqeH3KiYkma][Sober] but
this song increased this feeling significantly, the strings, her smooth vocals,
Kojey's vocals, all the smooth vocals makes the song for me. The raps are great too,
it is just a solid song not sure what else to say other than I'm probably going to go and
listen to her most recent EP :album[23K0dGES2wx588MYRSGnPu][Seasons]. And after listening this
song you will probably follow suit, what a vibe.

:lyrics[
  It was so scary
  One more fuck, we might just get married
  Well, I'll be back, no, please don't worry
  Didnâ€™t mean you no harm
  Left before the alarm
  But I'm never too far
