I feel like it has been a very good year for Dreamville, with Bas and Cole releasing some
solid albums respectively. But they weren't the stand outs from the collective, no that
accolade definitely must go to JID with one of the best rap albums of the year. It was
pretty much fire throughout the project, great production,fire bars, a tasteful amount of
features with great contributions from the likes of 6-lack, Joey and Cole. And let us not
forget some masterful performances from JID that put him easily in the top 10 of MCs. The
album is a joy to listen to. Hopefully this will start a friendly rivalry with TDE, I just
want the fire and collaborations to keep coming.
