It took me a while to get round to Hussle's newest project but finally it turns out that
everyone who lost their mind over it was at least somewhat warranted. I like a good few of
the songs on the album with the other not being bad but didn't do much for me. But the songs
I did love easily get me gassed:

:lyrics[
  Any prob I'ma reappear, with a squad you already fear,
  All this time I've been playin' fair, seven digits every single year,
  Niggas died, niggas disappear, alibis, I was really there

Nipsey comes with a flow throughout the project that makes it great. With the amazing
production an although there is a very high proportion of songs containing features on the
album. These add to the songs by providing good vocals or more bars. Overall it is a solid
album from the Crenshaw Cuzin and I am happy to have had it in my rotation.

:future-comment[
  I just have to say RIP Nipsey, every time I listen to these songs. I'm reminded of the music
  we missed out on.
