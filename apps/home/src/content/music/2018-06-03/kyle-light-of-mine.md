Okay so when the feel good king - as he shall now be named - releases a new project I am
excited. In my opinion, KYLE brings a lot to the rap scene with his can do attitude, noteworthy
flow and occasional vocals leading to a style which he can call his own. With this fact, I definitely expected
a lot more from this album than what was provided in this teenage drama of project. Don't get
me wrong, the subject matter is cool as is something that many a man has experienced in his
lifetime. But whether it was the skits being provided by the resident plague on the rap game
Lil Yachty or that the songs wer'nt really that good. I think the theme was a miss and led
to a lackluster experience. Which is really disappointing. Maybe I'm being unfair with
comparing this to his previous project :album[7ramtTKrOVLzbPjzGbSJgr][Smyle] - which I thought
was amazing by the way - I think there is a big difference between making comparisons
based off of them being different because of their quality when compared to the artist
trying something new. I'm not upset with KYLE doing something different, I'm upset that
it just feels like a miss to me and that is a shame.

:future-comment[
  I actually like Yachty now so that comment does seem a bit harsh to me nowadays - REACH THE SUNSHINE
  is all that was needed for redemption. It isn't rap but it sure is good.
