Out of the most of the A$AP Mob, Rocky is the one that I expect to come with the heat when
he brings out project. LONG LIVE and AT LONG LAST A$AP were great albums and had some great
songs on it from start to finish. Unfortunately I cannot say the same about this one. A lot
of the song just seem like an experiment that went wrong. Frankenstein's monster, trying to
cure Alzheimer's in Planet of the Apes, the American projects to name a few. I am all for
trying something new but the problem with this is that it doesn't sound good. Like all the
sub base at the start of the project in Distorted Records, I felt like my brain was rattling
in my skull.

Also the biggest problem with the project is that it lacks the quotables that makes Rocky
a serious rapper. When you have bars like:

> This year, I turned into a racist,
> All i want to see is green faces,
> All I want to count is green numbers,
> That shit is weird looking like the matrix,
> - Taken from Electric Body (feat. Schoolboy Q)

When compared to some of what I heard on this album some of it wasn't even comprehensible
or don't even make sense:

> Homeboy you ain't know (ends where they buck shot)
> Had a bitch suckin' on a lollipop at the bus stop
> Green Glock, Red Glock (buck shot) ??????????
> - Taken from Buck Shot - TESTING

Glocks do not shoot buck shots!!!! Like what is this bar talking about? This is part of the
problem with this album. I have no problem with swag rapping, which I usually hold the A$AP
Mob in high regard for. But if your just saying things for the sake of it, it ends up degrading
the whole experience. And after the first few songs this is most of TESTING for me. So for now
it pains me to say it but A$AP Twelvvy is the only one in the Mob who hasn't taken L's lately.
