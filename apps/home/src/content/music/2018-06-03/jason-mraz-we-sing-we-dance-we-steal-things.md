I think pretty much everyone of a certain age knows the song I'm yours by Mr Mraz. And deep
into a hole of revision I decided to go and listen to the album that contained it. I was
pleasantly surprised. What I expected to be a plethora of generic pop songs but instead it
contained many horns and instruments more in tune with the wonderful world of jazz. However,
small this influence may be I have to hand in to Jason, he can put together some good songs
and this is this album in a nut shell. The album is long and this is not necessarily a good
thing as I don't think that all the songs in its entirety have the same strength as this on
born sinner do. But if your looking for something feel good, from the guy who made some
serious childhood anthems, then I don't see why you wouldn't give this a listen, there is
something to like on it.
