After listening to KOD several times I did one of my listening to an older j.cole project
because that was due. And this time I went back and listened to born sinner which is criminally
underrated in my humble opinion. Firstly, the production is amazing from the start to finish
as soon as Villuminati drops you know what your in for. And what is more is that this is
sustained throughout a sizeable amount of songs, 18 in total. I can listen to this front to
back and not skip a song. There may be some that are better than others but I can say with
confidence that all are solid.


And finally the showstoppers, the songs where you ask yourself how did he put this together.
The message he gives in the songs like for example Runaway which has been a mainstay in my
playlist as of late:

> Rich white men rule the nation still
> The difference is we're all slaves now the chain concealed,
> - Taken from Runaway - born sinner

Instilled onto me a feeling of awe when I first heard the third verse. The very personal
let Nas down or the album title song Born Sinner. These take this project from just a solid
album to one of the great and I will urge you a million times to give it a listen. Often
overlooked for his later work born sinner deserves to be recognised as one of the greats,
so give it a listen.
