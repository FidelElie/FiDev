Have you ever heard a track that sent chills your spine. That's what happened when my
girlfriend Olivia (shout outs to Young Spinach) showed me the song Plastic off his album
and I had to check it out. When I first listened to it I found many parallels and made many
comparisons. These thoughts also come up alot when I was recommending him to Dre and he
asked me what genre he falls under. After more thought as I didn't find it easy at all to
explain it then. The instrumentation he uses through his songs really reminds me of Laura
Mvula's latest work the dreaming room but with the added benefit of this Moses's voice
being unique beyond belief. These both work so well together that every song is an
experience in its own right. For example the drum section on Quarrel is an amazing drop.
Some music can definitely transport you somewhere else and it with this it feel like I
definitely went into the wardrobe. Some of the best stuff i've heard all year, props to
Sumney.
