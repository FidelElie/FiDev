In the exam period I found myself not really listening to newer stuff as much when it came
out week by week. But instead venturing back to what I know and old playlists alike. And
this led me back to Newton faulkner, some of the first songs added on my Spotify all those
years ago. I have a place in my heart for some good folk music and I believe he delivers
on this. In many instances less is more and I think many of his songs - at least the ones
that I love - follow this paradigm. Simple hooks like gone in the morning that as writing
this I couldn't stop singing along. I was first introduced to the world when my dad was
listening to Bob Dylan and I think Newton solidified my fascination with the genre. And
going back to this album always reminds me of this. It is a solid album and whether you
love folk or are looking for something new to listen to, this might be a good place to
start.
