After listening to JAYZ's :album[7GoZNNb7Yl74fpk8Z6I2cv][4:44] I had to find
out where the sample came for song of the same name. And the whole song is amazing too,
NO I.D definitely picked a winner to use for the album.

I really like the progression of this song the transitions for each instrument is so clean
and with Hannah's vocals it culminates in the finale of the song and where the main sample
comes from. It is a well put together song and I would recommend giving it a listen. Just
be sure to listen to the lyrics of the song before you tell your girlfriend this reminds
you of her. Clarify that it is because the song is good not the lyrics, you'll thank me later.
