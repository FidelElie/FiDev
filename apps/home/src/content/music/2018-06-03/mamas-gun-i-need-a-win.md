Since I've been visiting home I have found myself getting reacquainted with the wonderful
platform of the radio. And yes I do hate the radio, it is usually full of blown out pop
songs and crap that I don't want my ears to experience. But if you are on the right frequency
you can find some gems and that is something I am use to when listening to radio London at
the right time of day because of my dad and his fixation with the platform. I overheard this
song on this station (and I have discovered so much music on this in the past) and this song
sounds great. I love the instrumentation, the punchy baseline is definitely a standout of
the song, it reminds me some old bands like the Isley Brothers or the Commodores. And the
vocals are great and contribute to an overall solid song.
