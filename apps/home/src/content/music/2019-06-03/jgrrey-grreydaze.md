Sometimes Spotify likes to throw some more obscure artists on their new releases roundup.
And although I had heard of JGrrey before, I had no idea she had released something. After
giving it a listen I would rate the entire project as mediocre. Most of the songs are pretty
forgettable, they weren't bad by any means. There just nothing to right home about. The
thorough among you might have noticed however, that there is a favourite song listed.
God's House is definitely a standout song on the project, it is not even a close competition.
