This was a big surprise as I didn't think Mr Suleiman was releasing anything anytime soon.
I was just very contempt with all the singles he has released before this, but I have got
to say I am very happy that he did. It is an amazing project that inherits much of the style
and the subject matter that was used in Ady's previous work, with some of the songs I've
heard before being on the album. But there is a lot of songs to like on it. I do think some o
f the songs do start off a bit slow but when they start, I find myself always swaying to
the amazing vocals and great vocals. After a few rotations of listens I can say with some
confidence thats it is up there with what I've heard this year. So thank you Ady you
made the week that much better.â€¯
