I saw these guys tiny desk performance (linked below) and I was like yo I should go back
and listen to this again. And I forgot how much of a great project this duo put out last year.
It is just funky af and I loved every minute of it.  If you just want body roll a bit in
your seat or on the move then this will do it for you. Give it a listen you won't be disappointed.
