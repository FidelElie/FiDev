Here lies Bobby Tarantino 2 after the prediction I made with :track[4EAV2cKiqKP5UPZmY6dejk][Everyday].
And after a couple listens so far it is pretty good. You can tell Logic is ridiculously gassed
in this project. But can I blame him he's been winning - maybe not as much to me but numbers don't lie.

:lyrics[
  And I hereby ratify and confirm that Logic is mother-fucking paid

  The winning is even said in the song
]

Pretty much all of the project is just a bigâ€¯ bragging fest and there is nothing wrong with
it. Not all songs hit for me but the ones that did really did.
:track[0jqBo5RYn008f4ZY8kPewW][Indica Badu]... The song is fucking amazing and just reminds
me of the older Logic that I grew to love. Super smooth and Wiz goes in so if anything listen
to that. Overall though, I do like this project it is not my favorite from him by any means
but it is something that I can see myself bumping for a bit. So now I'm just hoping that
the album is good.
