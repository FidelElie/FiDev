What can I say about this song? I first heard it in the tv show Suits and for the Borderlands 2
soundtrack, the clips that these use do not do the song justice. From the Crackling from the cowboy
walking into the saloon at the start to the end is just some of the best of what the heavy
does. And that is mesh the amazing raspy vocals of the lead man Kelvin Swaby with the
instrumental it is an amazing experience from beginning to end. For many including me, this
was the start of their love for THe Heavy and after listening to it there is a high chance
that you will follow suit. What an amazing song.
