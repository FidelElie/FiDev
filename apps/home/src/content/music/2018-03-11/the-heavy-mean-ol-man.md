From their newest album, :album[6PlWoMmg7iwVAgUwh5UCgL][Hurt & The Merciless] is a great
song that also shows how well this bands' sound meshes together so well to make great songs.
Taking the part of the hook for example:

:lyrics[
  And I don't mean to be cruel, I didn't mean to hurt you
][
  Mean Ol' Man
]

Sang with the backing singers sounds amazing. This song is about the full package:
the vocals, the guitar, they all mesh together to give some of the same feelings that I
get when I listen to what makes a good man? A song that I always have to move to it is a
great listen.
