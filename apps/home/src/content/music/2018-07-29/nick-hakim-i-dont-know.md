Nick has been one of my favorite artists for the past couple years. His music is airy and
his voice is amazing and brings together all the songs he does. I love his last album
:album[3QqPgCaqDKmskJqijCG7sV][Green Twins] very much, it was one of my favorite albums
last year. But I wanted to showcase the song that started it all for me. It is a masterpiece
to me, so much so that I remember the first time I was listening to it...

It was a cold night in December a couple of years ago and I was revising for impending university exams in the
early hours of the morning. I had heard his song :track[2ty2vBXzBYKJI1QFnSh5Hy][Lift Me Up]
and I decided to listen to more of his catalog. I remember putting this song on, quickly putting down my
pen and closing my eyes and being transported somewhere else. The silky smooth vocals in the
verses and the chorus is what do it for me. As mixed with instrumentation of the song it results
in the the whole experience being a journey to me. I can't tell you how much I love it, still
my favorite song of his to this day. Amazing artist, amazing song go and give Mr Hakim a listen.
