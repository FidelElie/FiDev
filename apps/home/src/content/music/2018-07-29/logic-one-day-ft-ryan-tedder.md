This song is a good positive song which reminds me of the older song As I Am which I do like.
But this song ultimately falls from grace because nowadays I get triggered every time this
guy mentions anything to do with race. Like I'm all for tackling issues, but now it
seems you just throw in there because you can't fully rap about something else. At least I
only heard it once but c'mon Logic do :album[1Mk7Lei0Ra3hawezqmad5V][Under Pressure] or
:album[5dOpbgAmJeyoakKQ0QLWkR][Incredible True Story] and chill with
all that - or do it better. All this aside, his rap is pretty good and Ryan's lyrics are cool.
Just stop being such the superhero Biracial Boy all the time. We get it and I know you can
make some great stuff so just do it.
