Last Friday came along and I was doing my ritual of looking at the new releases and I
stumbled across this album. I didn't know who Buddy was until then but I decided to give the
project a listen and it bangs. Catchy hooks, seriously smooth flows and vocals and some great
production with all the funk describes the album for me. Buddy brings two sides to his music,
a very chill and laid back vibe as well as a more turn up flavor in some songs. This has had
me listening to it while I'm chilling at home or going hard in the gym. Which I can't say
for many artists these days, who cant find the balance they are looking for. The only thing
I didn't really like was the Ty feature, just because on the song I think his presence was
squandered. But other than this I am really feeling Buddy's debut, give it a listen and
see what you think.
