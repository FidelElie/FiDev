I listened to this EP years ago, much closer to its release in 2014 and admittedly I have
been sleeping on it ever since. Firstly I love Tillman's voice, he is able to hold some
very high notes and the best thing about this is, it is not just because he can. It helps
take the songs from just a medley of great instrumentation to something that is much more
than the sum of its parts. An experience that I did not really appreciate as much back then,
dismissing at being more boring, rather than looking into its intricacies. The project is
calming, something you can close your eyes and listen to, not really for turning up to. And
that doesn't mean it is boring, just for a different time and a different place. That time
and place is now and here for me.
