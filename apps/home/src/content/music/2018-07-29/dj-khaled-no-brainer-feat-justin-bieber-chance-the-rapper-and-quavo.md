I didn't even know this was going to be released and honestly I did not care. The last song
that this group put out was seen as generic summer trash, with a box standard beat , hook
and raps. Which is definitely hurts me to say it because I love Chance and Quavo. And this
song is no different, maybe I should blame Khaled for this one. So let me now define the
Major Key (We da best music) checklist for a track. Boring beat, check, boring hook, check,
rappers who do it for the culture, check. It is the major key to a fat cheque for them, but
doesn't result in a good song. If I was to try and find something positive to say about the
song. I did find Chance's verse okay though but light years from his best. Its being removed
from my playlist, what a bummer, one of the most disappointing songs of the year.
