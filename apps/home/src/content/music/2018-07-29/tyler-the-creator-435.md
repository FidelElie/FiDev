In looking for Tyler's newest release I stumbled across this song, it is some really smooth
hip hop. Very short and sweet, one take excellence as he talks about in the song itself.
There is not much to say about it other then instrumentation is typical Tyler which is a
very good thing. With the very prominent horns it is just a solid solid song. I'm looking
forward to finally listening to the other song I was looking for. they'll probably be good.
