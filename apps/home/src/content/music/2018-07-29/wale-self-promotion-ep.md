With a departure which was the more R'n'B centric project that is It's Complicated,
Wale come on his rappity rap shit with Self Promotion and it is another W for him. I think
that the reason why like his bars in the project - other than the afro-centric lyrics.
Is that he rides the beat in these songs so well, Wale's flow is too clean on these tracks.
And it also helps that he has some serious bars to get off his chest (or pad):

:lyrics[
  I feel like Ali, but feel like I be with all the cash is
][Cassius (Excellency) (feat. DJ Money):2jdWwK988PmmkBDA76PhmO]

And they keep coming in this EP, the only blemish is that I didn't like the third song very much.
I found the hook very laughable but this doesn't take away from how the great the others are and
how good the project is on the whole. Keep them coming Wale.

  Uh, yo, my opposition ain't no competition
What you call a booth I call a kitchen, I'm fryin' different
