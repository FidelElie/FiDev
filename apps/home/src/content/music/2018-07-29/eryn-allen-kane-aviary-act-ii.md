This is a very different sound from the previous act but this is definitely not an issue.
She went with one of the greatest influences ever created, the Mowtown sound. Like a new age
Gladys, a Diana Ross in 2018. With each song this becomes harder and harder to deny with
the style shown in this project. I am very surprised to hear this change, I would have
never expected it from what I heard from Act I. Which might sound a bit dumb, as this might
have been a no-brainer to some. But all this being said I am happy where it went, this is a
great project and has solidified me as a fan of hers. Can't wait to see what Eryn releases
next.
