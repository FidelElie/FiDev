I liked everything about this song: the beat bangs, there is a violin sample that comes in
at the end of the chorus that give me chills it sounds so good. Chance's rap is great,
his flow makes you want to shimmy. The chorus is seven different words not much to dislike
there. But the only thing I wasn't too fond of was Supa Bwe rap. Just like his name it
seemed a bit overdone to me, like he was doing a bit too much in his rap. If I could say
some good about it, it would be that it was not terrible, nor was it long. The only blemish
in a great song for me. On a side note although he is saying Wala Cam to me it sounds like
While I Can sometimes which is also cool and did lead to me liking the song more.
