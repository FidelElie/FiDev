I finally managed to listen to Nines' newest project and from first impressions  I've got
to say overall I like a lot of his bars but I think that it is not my cup of tea. I think
it was because overall what hes saying is a lot of the same, but the best thing about the
album is how he says it. With bars like:

> Revolver in your face, call it views from the 6
- taken from Trapstar - Crop Circle

Nines definitely has some heat to spit, but I think with the combination of the lackluster
hooks and the production on some of the song not really getting me jumping. I expected a
bit more from it. This being said there are some songs on this album that I are definitely
straight flames all the way through. So as result I am definitely going to listen to a bit
more and see if my mind changes.
