I finally managed to listen to Hov's newest release after a while of nagging. A friend
(shoutouts to Cheese) sent me a link to the dramatized versions of the songs on Youtube.
I was trying not to (allegedly) bootleg the project but this was the next thing. Well
after listening to it, I took out a free trial on TIDAL and will be buying the album to
put on Spotify when the time comes. His talk of topics like his cheating, money and the
black community are harrowing and so poetic. I always knew the JAY was serious with the
rhymes but I never really got into him like that. But it is great to see an album that
actually makes you think about issues, it can sometimes seem like that is a scarcity
these days. Some people tip toe around subjects and some handle them head on. There are
great rappers who do this: Cole who I talked about above, Kendrick and now I remember
that Mr JAY-Z fits this bill. This album is also amazing because the production that NO
I.D brings is ridiculous! The samples he used, how they were sliced are masterful and
keeps me coming back for more. Will this album have me keeping tidal for the next release?
No probably not but I will probably be buying the album outright. This one will need some
company. There may not be as many places to listen to it as the other music but listen to
it on YouTube if all else fails, the videos are great. Give Hov the listen that this album
deserves.
