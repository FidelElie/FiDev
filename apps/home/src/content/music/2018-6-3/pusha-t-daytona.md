With all that is going on with Kanye in his personal life, he still knows how to give some
serious production. And at least for now for the music, I can put that some of the stupid
crap a side, ignore the insensitive album cover and listen to what Pusha T has to say. Even
if all this stuff is a publicity stunt I was going to listen to it anyway so for lack of a
better phrase I am not going to buy into the bullshit. I just want to listen to some good
music and Daytona is not half bad. I have never been a fan of Pusha but his flow in unison
with the Kanye's production on this leads to a hard seven tracks. For me it wasn't anything
ground breaking though as it seems social media has been shouting for the past few weeks.
I've probably been a bit sidetracked with everything to really scrutinize the greatness of it,
but it will be in the rotation as it is a pretty good body of work and I will hopefully find
the time to listen to some of his older stuff.

On a side note is this an EP or an album? I keep hearing this is an album tried to scroll to
see the other songs on it and there was 7 of them. So what is it. Is it a playlist like
Pusha's now arch enemy drake would say? I have no idea but back to the music overall, I g
ive it a listen there is something to like from his latest outing.
