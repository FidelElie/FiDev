This is one of my girlfriends favorite Frank Ocean songs. And the multiple times she has
showed me it, I can see why. The piano throughout song, Jay's contribution to the song and
of course Frank leads to a well put together song. It has quickly become one of my favorite
Frank songs myself, the instrumentation is expertly put together and with Frank's voice through
the verses to the finale.... The finale (You'll know what I'm talking about when you hear it)
is ridiculous. Tyler's contribution is smooth and even though nothing really stood out in what
he was saying in the song, it doesn't take away from the experience at all.
