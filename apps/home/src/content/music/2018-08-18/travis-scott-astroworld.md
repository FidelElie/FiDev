After postponing the writing of this entry for a week to try and get a better feel for this
album. It seems like nothing has really changed with it. I still have no idea what I truly
like or dislike about Travis' newest. Like a lot of the songs I hear in passing aren't good
but they are not particularly bad either. With his signature production, auto-tune and
occasional banger of a bar. I think that some of the features on this in questionable - I
will say this again, Nav shouldn't be allowed into studios unless it is to clean up.

But even that song wasn't even that bad. I'm not sure if after listening to this for a couple
of weeks and still not having a set opinion on it. Means its bad, or if I give it one more
listen I will be finally hear the genius that I've heard (and was expecting) from Travis.
But since this is him and I've been hearing a lot of differing opinions on it.
I am determined to actually solidify my opinion on it, even if it takes the rest of the year
to do it. So for now give it a listen and make your own mind up.

:future-comment[
  I finally managed to solidify my opinion after years of listening to the albums' songs
  and yes this hit much harder than I gave it credit for back then. No wonder people
  would look at me weird at socials when I would mention I thought it was mediocre.
