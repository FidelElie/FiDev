It is about time that I get one of my favorite artists of all time on here. I love me some
Barry White, and in my travels lately I have found myself on the London underground trying
to past the time from place to place. This is 12 minutes of Barry at his best (And I think
this alliteration was used throughout his career, the man only made fire). Since this song
is so long let me split into two parts: the initial instrumental and everything after the drop.
Mr White is very renown for what came with him the Love Unlimited Orchestra (best name ever)
and this song just reinforces this. They were exceptional throughout the song, but the first
part allows them to really flex. With an amazing string section that is very calming.

But then the drop comes and the journey continues into part 2, where the silky smooth voice
comes in. The instrumentation picks up and barry, tells whatever woman he wrote this about
how he feels. It is pretty much two songs in one, and it is a masterpiece in my mind. And
I only discovered this song a year ago. It has quickly became one my favorites. Love this
song, give it a listen.
