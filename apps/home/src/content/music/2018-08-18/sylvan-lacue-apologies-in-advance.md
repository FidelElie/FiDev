This is another recommendation from my podcast co-host Jesse and it is a conceptual album
to contend with. The album is all about self-reflection and human nature, it is uplifting
in some places and down-right thought provoking in others. And this would be before you
even hear the music. Because the thing is, this album is so conceptual that what seems like
most of it is the skit that accompanies it. There is a lot of story to tell with this album
so I would implore you to listen to it as a full body of work if you want to get
the full experience. In places its like your listening to a podcast with music breaks. But
at least those breaks are pretty good.â€¯

The hip hop on offer here does have its own merits. And I do feel like in places comparisons
could be made to Kendrick but Sylvan does enough in his performance to stand out. Overall
I think what draws me to the music the most is the production. Just listen to the trap beat
with a classical sample on :track[0BvwSWaY6z31vyXOCh2zIb][Selfish] you will see what I am
saying. The album screams creativity to me, and that is what I like about it the most.
This is some great work.
