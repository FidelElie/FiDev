I didn't think I was going to like this tape. From what I've heard of RAYE before I was really
a fan of her music, but I've got to say.. I am generally surprised how much I like some of
the songs on this project. I have them on repeat for the for a while now. The songs I like
the most on this album, are very upbeat, high-tempo songs with some having afrobeat
influences (:track[31MUzJRDoberNLCXSISodO][Crew]), and just straight up RnB with little bit
of electronic thrown in, in places.

The production on the project is so good that I, find myself doing the typical scrunch face,
that is evidence of a hard beat a lot while listening to this. The other songs on the EP are
not the greatest but they are definitely tolerable. She doesn't say anything truly profound
but who cares this stuff gets me gassed. It is pretty solid, so I'll definitely look out for
what she does next.
