I didn't even know H.E.R was releasing anything in the past couple weeks. And I didn't think
she was releasing anything like the first song on the project Lauryn Hill much? She broke
it down and I was like "Holy shit this is so good", this shit is going to be
:album[1BZoqf8Zje5nGdwZhOjAtD][The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill] 2.
But this led to the only thing I am really disappointed with in this album. It didn't go
that way, it goes back to typical H.E.R.

But I did get past this pretty quickly because although it is typical H.E.R R'n'B, that is a very good thing.
She has been doing bits for a while now and this project is no exception.
I just want to see where can go with the flavor of the first song. That shit is too good.â€¯
