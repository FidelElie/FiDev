I think of this song as a bit of a teaser for his newest album. Mick decided to release this,
to tell us how he feels and what he is going to bring. And with bars like:

:lyrics[
  Honestly can't nobody come for 'cept Kendrick
  And I hope you offended, like it's untrue
  Don't make me debunk your kung-fu
  Fuck up the whole Feng shui when we come through
][Bruce Banner]

He has a lot to say and this album is going to be a lot to take in. This song is one big
poetically driven flex, as Mick can bring the bars when he wants to. And overall I can't
be mad at that. The production is solid too, this song has got me pretty excited to listen
to his next big project, shouldn't be long before I get to see if his claims are warranted.
