This song spurred me to go back and listen Jungle's self titled album :album[2B1PHvqJTX9ELdUlENOJeQ][Jungle].
And this song follows the same blueprint as their others song. With the same electronic aspects
and the chill vocals. Which come to think of it, I find a bit weird, I don't think it is the
tonality of it, the delivery or the post-production. But it sounds very different to what I
am accustomed to. It is a pretty simple song that I liked the sound of, not much else to say
really. If you've liked Jungle before you'll probably like this one, and if you haven't
who knows give it a shot anyway, I did.
