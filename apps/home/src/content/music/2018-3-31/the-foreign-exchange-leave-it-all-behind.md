This is one from the archives, but when I decided to give it a listen towards it had to
have a place on the is week's roundup. It is a great R&B album with its very good production
from one half of the duo and it is a very different direction from the foreign exchange put
out before and after it. It is still my favorite of their projects because I think it hits
the right balance with the vocals and subject matter. As the beats are not the most conventional
when it comes to listening to R&B especially in the modern day or even back in 2008 when
this was released. It is a great experience and I urge you to go back and listen to this
chill masterpiece for yourself so you can see what I am talking about first hand.
