I was thinking to myself this week that I haven't listened to myself in a longtime, so I
decided to go back to my older playlist and give one of my favorite songs a listen. Taking
me back to a time where I wasn't actually born this song has a great old school vibe to the
instrumental that I love a lot. I think my vocals on this song were also great, more of the
usual a couple high notes but the flow of the song is nice and I do like the subject matter
(I did write it after all). And these days above all it does seem like this song is very
fitting, so I gave myself a pat on the back for this one.
