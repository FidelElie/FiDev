It seems like Its inevitable that I am reminded how much I love espionage on TV and in cinema.
James Bond, Jason Bourne, Jack Ryan (didn't realise how much of them started with J). Ethan Hunt
from Mission Impossible for some variation in first letter names. However, all of them have to make way
for the day of the Jackal. It has it all: the twists and turns, stylised shots, crazy gadgets
and with all this it still manages to remain grounded in its scope. This isn't actually a review
of the series but what also what makes it standout is it's killer soundtrack that starts no
further than it's theme song.

Celeste fits the vibe perfectly - the raspiness in her voice makes for the mysterious almost
regal aspect that can be found in any of the James bond themes (at least the good ones - I'm
looking at you :track[3ODl8J0TZAykdMCtCIO28n][Another Way to Die]). It screams spy shit and I
dig it, I don't know what else to say - it is epic how well this was put together and for a
TV show - a great one at that. I'm not on the payroll but binge watch the show and if you're
not interested in spies and assassins, still listen to this you'll probably like it anyway.
