Jevon has been in my rotation heavily for the past couple weeks since Carlos showed me him.
And it is for good reason. The London native - who is from down the road from where I am from
might I add. Can do it all, it seems from rapping and making some amazing hip hop songs
(check out :track[3MgybEIF6DHh7mpPsyHJtw][Do The Road]). To making the more R'n'B inspired
tracks that we are talking about now. He has honed his craft for a long time now and it seems
like, all the hard work is coming to pass.

But back to this song in particular, Paranoia is one of my favourite R'n'b songs of the year.
From the hook:

:lyrics[
  All this sin girl, got a hole me
  Paranoia take control of me
][Paranoia]

To his singing throughout the tracks, he does an amazing job of keeping with what
makes R'n'B great. The subject matter, instrumentation and the vocals. But he also manages
to add his own do the road flavour to it in the process. Listen to the song; Jevon takes a
fat W with it.
