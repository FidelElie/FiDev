This song has stolen the show for me for what seems like an age now. To summarize it I will
have to say: the beat, the bars, the visuals and the road. Now for the longer answer, the
beat is so good that me trying to explain it wouldn't do it justice. There is something about
the synths in the background that get me gassed every single time I listen to it. The bars
are expertly crafted and delivered in the song, making you actually feel for what he is saying
that his life entailed.

The visuals for this song, I think have set a standard for what hood videos should be like
these days. More about the artistry then someone just rapping with all the gang standing
behind them throwing up gang signs. I find myself going out of my way to go to YouTube at
times to listen to the song there. And finally the it all culminates in making me feel like
I want to do the road.

So listen to this tune, on your favourite streaming service or YouTube - the YouTube version
is extended - and worth a separate listen entirely. Jevon is doing it for Londoners everywhere.
