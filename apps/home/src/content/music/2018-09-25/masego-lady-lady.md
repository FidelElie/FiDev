When this came out I was really looking forward to it and although it has lost some steam
since I still believe it was a solid project. No Lost thoughts or pink polo EP but still very
solids. There are some highlight song on this where Uncle Sego really comes through what he
does best, everything. A lot of different instruments are heard throughout the project and
with his singing and the guest features it is something nice to listen to. But that's just
it, it isn't amazing or ground-breaking, its just nice. Well that is better than it being trash,
so good shit Sego.
