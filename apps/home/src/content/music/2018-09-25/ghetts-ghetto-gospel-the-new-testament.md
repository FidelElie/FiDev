What can I say about this? It fucking bumps. Ghetts bars are top notch throughout this
holy album, he mentions his mum, he talks about his long hiatus and it all flames. I've
always loved the aggressiveness he brings to spitting. And something that I really appreciate
in all this s he manages to uphold this aggression and still have some humour within his songs:

> I was gonna ring this girl but something in my brain said don't dial
> Instead I rung Spyro
> Yo family what you doin' I'm on the high road, I beg a man send
> Somethin' new
> I a'int made a tune in a minute y'know g
> That's cool, send somethin' from the old file
> When it comes to flows, I know styles
> When it comes to dough, I know piles
> When it comes to road, I know miles
- taken from Pick up the phone


This is one of many examples that I just enjoy throughout the album.
And the features he used were all pretty solid although I think the Simz feature could be
better. Overall this is one of my favourite songs of the year. Shoutouts Carlos for putting
me onto it.
