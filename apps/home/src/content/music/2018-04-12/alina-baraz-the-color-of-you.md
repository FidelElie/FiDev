I really liked Alina Baraz's collaboration with Galamatias on Fantasy, the vocals she puts
down are really good on that song, super smooth. These vocals carry on to her solo project,
with beats that follow on from this. I do really like her sound with its mellow aspects and
this is greatly reinforced by the great production on each song. I may not like every song
on the album but they're are some stand outs on this one. Its a really nice listen and I
would recommend it to anyone who wants to chill out and relax, or focus on revision for
impending exams like I have.
