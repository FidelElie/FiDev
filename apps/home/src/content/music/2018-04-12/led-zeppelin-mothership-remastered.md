I am a big fan of older rock bands like Queen, Rainbow and as you can see from this project
Led Zeppelin. This is the album I always use to listen to when I was younger and admittedly
never use to get to the second part. I don't blame my younger self though this side of the
record is amazing. Amazing Vocals from Robert Plant and one of the best guitar of the time
with Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones on bass and keys and John Bonham on drums they were a force
to reckoned with. And when I went back to listen to this side I remembered why. There is so
many amazing journeys on it all culminating in the masterfully crafted Stairway To Heaven,
which is easily one of the greatest wrongs songs ever made because of its gentle progression.
Since I've been loving you is one of the finest blues songs I have ever heard, with the wailing
guitar at its forefront. And only recently, I realized Babe I'm going To Leave You is an
experience worth its weight in gold. I've loved this band since I was a child and if you
haven't any of their music I think this is a great start. So I have to say thank you to my
Dad for giving me the opportunity to experience it.
