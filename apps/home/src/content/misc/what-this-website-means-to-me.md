## What this website means to me

### Introduction

This website is a milestone for me, it is beyond: the technologies I used to make it, the code
I wrote to make it a reality, all of the iterations that have happened up to this point (there
has been way to many of those - two many rewrites...). It is
a return to something I loved way back when - writing. I am going to explain the significance
of this throughout this post and to start lets a take a trip back in time.

### Humble beginnings v1.0.0
The year is ~ 2017, I'm at university studying Physics - patiently waiting to start enjoying that -
and in the meantime doing whatever I can to past the time. In that time I managed to start two
different Youtube channels, learn't how to create videos for them. Which led to me getting into
photography when I got a camera to film videos. I also even dabbled in a very short spell of
trying to be [Metro boomin'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Boomin) (music production),
this did not last long and to this day I haven't fully recovered from all the buttons and dials
on FL Studio and how each tutorial would say yeah I just did this because I felt like it leading
to the creation of an actual cohesive song - but I digress. This all culminated in what you see
below a website that I put together using Wordpress.org to talk about music, computers and the
games that I managed to play.

This led to almost a whole year of what i liked to call Music Weekly a series of posts where
I would talk about the music i had listened to in the period between the posts. This was definitely
the most popular offering but also led to podcast with friends where we continued the discussions.

This didn't last forever and unfortunately life did get in the way and the posts got fewer and
further between until they ultimately ceased. I tend to be hard on myself thinking back but getting
to almost a year of the series was major and this idea has served as the catalyst for getting anything
released in the present day.


### The catalyst
In all the iterations that I have up until this point: to different types of dynamic CVs and figuring out
how I even enjoyed writing content in the present - thinking how much I loved writing about
music spurred the current version of the website. Causing me to try and unearth the old website
and all the old posts that it had on it. This brought me the [Wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/),
an amazing website that allows you to peer into the past of the internet where snapshot has
been taken and luckily it captured some of the website.

Peering back into what was a skeleton of the old site - images are missing in places but the general
functionality that you saw in the video above was still there - allowed me to focus the scope of
the new project.

* I needed a simple way to manage content: towards the end of the wordpress site's life, I was writing
all the content for the website in EverNote and OneNote using html tags. This was not the best experience
but better than actually using the site builder for any extended period of time.
* Creating music posts took ages: I had to get all the assets and embeds for the different streaming
services by google searching them - I attempted to write a desktop application that used python and
webscraping to automate this but it never got to primetime in my workflow.
* The old site was simple in layout and elements - simple is good...

### The outcome v2.0.0
I had only touched the surface of coding by the time old site was sunsetting, but now I could really
have some fun trying to solve the problems above and I can geek out for days about some of
what I put into the making of this but I think the video below can at least give you the idea of how
I solved the second point - something that spurred much of the development of this project up to its
release.

</figure>

The flow above is a game changer, I keep the content close to the code it gives me the power
to create posts very quickly for any music I want to talk about. It made migrating all the older
posts I found on the note taking apps a breeze and creating the newest post :post[music/2024-10-29/bad-bunny-monaco:post]
to mark my return to game even easier.


### Conclusion
This is just the beginning for this new start that I have given myself, I want to document the
progress all my projects, code more cool shit and of course write about much more music and even
with all I've learn't I can still look back and thank younger Fidel for all his university and wordpress stresses.
It was all worth it buddy.
